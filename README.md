## About

My "secret" blog is a collection of my thoughts and experiences as a computer
science student at Rice University and as a software engineer. I write about
technical topics ranging from theory and algorithms to software development and
data science. I also explore potpourri topics such as information security,
productivity, and personal development.

### Tools

The blog is built with [Zola](https://www.getzola.org/), a fast static site
generator written in Rust, and its theme is a custom theme I developed called
`radion` that can be found [here](https://github.com/micahkepe/radion).
