A different type of CLI AI tool.

## Introduction

Fabric isn't just another AI CLI—it’s a tool for thinking, building, and
accelerating your digital workflows. Designed by [Daniel Miessler](https://danielmiessler.com/),
Fabric is a **Unix-native command-line interface** that connects you directly
to AI through a growing library of "Patterns"—curated, open-source system
prompts engineered to solve real problems with minimal friction.

If you're someone who works with text, consumes a lot of content, or just
wants to streamline repetitive tasks like summarizing videos, extracting
insights, or analyzing messy logs, **Fabric is a force multiplier**. You’re
not just using AI—you’re shaping it into a functional extension of your own
workflow.

## Why Fabric?

Fabric is not about showing off what AI can do. It's about getting things
done **with less cognitive overhead**, **fewer clicks**, and **more
composability**.

Here’s why it stands out:

- **Frictionless AI Access**: Fabric removes the need to visit web
  interfaces, load custom GPTs, or rephrase prompts manually. Everything is
  piped directly through the terminal, your clipboard, or even local APIs.

- **Patterns = Reusable Intelligence**: Every Pattern is a reproducible,
  editable Markdown file that acts like a modular skill. Want to extract
  insights from a 2-hour video, generate a concise summary, and turn it into
  a PDF? That’s three chained Patterns. And yes, it's that simple:

  ```bash
  yt "https://youtu.be/example" | fabric -p extract_wisdom | fabric -p write_latex | to_pdf
  ```

- **A Philosophy of Augmentation**: Fabric is built on the idea that AI is
  here to augment, not replace, human thinking. It helps you **filter**,
  **distill**, and **act** on information faster—without compromising
  intentionality or depth.

- **Text as the Interface**: Embrace the "world of text" paradigm. Fabric
  works best when everything is treatable as text: podcasts become
  transcripts, notes become markdown, and logs become structured data. Once
  it’s in text, AI can help.

- **Crowdsourced and Customizable**: Want to create a pattern for summarizing
  lecture notes, filtering weekly reflections, or analyzing study group
  transcripts? You can. And your pattern stays local—unless you choose to
  share it with the community.

## Real Workflows That Show the Power

Here are **battle-tested examples** that demonstrate Fabric’s raw utility:

1. **Research Synthesis**
   Extract key points from academic papers and create tweet-length takeaways:

   ```bash
   pbpaste | fabric -p extract_wisdom | fabric -p create_micro_summary
   ```

2. **Understand Foreign Codebases Quickly**
   Instantly grok unfamiliar C or Python blocks:

   ```bash
   pbpaste | fabric -p explain_code
   ```

3. **Summarize Long YouTube Videos in Seconds**
   Stop wasting time scrubbing through 2-hour interviews:

   ```bash
   fabric -y "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXs-zPc63kM" -p extract_wisdom
   ```

4. **Log Analysis for Developers and Sysadmins**
   Triage messy logs and find root causes without writing a regex:

   ```bash
   fabric -p analyze_logs < /var/log/syslog
   ```

5. **Markdown in, Markdown out**
   Fabric plays well with Obsidian, your second brain:

   ```bash
   pbpaste | fabric -p extract_wisdom | fabric save
   ```

## The Philosophy Behind It

Fabric isn’t trying to be a chatbot. It’s trying to be **your AI
layer**—invisible, modular, and fast.

### "Patterns" Are the Secret Sauce

A Pattern is essentially a prompt distilled into a repeatable tool. It’s AI
prompt engineering made simple, composable, and transparent.

Want to inspect or improve a Pattern? Just open the Markdown:

```bash
~/.config/fabric/patterns/extract_wisdom/system.md
```

And if you're unsure how to craft one, there's a Pattern for that too:
`improve_prompt`.

### Human-Centric Design

In interviews, Miessler has said that he didn’t build Fabric to automate
life—he built it to **make space for more meaningful work**. His idea of a
"world of text" means anything that can be turned into text is fair game for
Fabric—and AI. Transcripts, logs, journals, notes, sermon recordings—turn
them into signal, not noise.

Fabric helps you decide:

- What’s worth reading?
- What deserves deep thought?
- What should be distilled and filed?

## Basic Setup (in 60 seconds)

To install, follow the [GitHub instructions](https://github.com/danielmiessler/fabric),
or if you're in a hurry:

```bash
brew install fabric-ai # macOS
yay -S fabric-ai        # Arch Linux
go install github.com/danielmiessler/fabric@latest
```

Run `fabric --setup` to add your API keys for OpenAI, Anthropic, Grok, or a
local LLM server:

)}}

> **NOTE**: Use `alias fabric='fabric-ai'` if installed via package manager.

## Final Word

Fabric isn’t flashy. It doesn’t gamify. What it **does** is help you move
faster, think better, and work smarter.

If your workflow involves summarizing, extracting, transforming, or
interacting with anything in text form—and you like the CLI—you owe it to
yourself to try Fabric.
