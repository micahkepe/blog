I've ditched my traditional keyboard for a split keyboard. Here's why I made the
switch and how I'm finding it so far.

# Why?

A few months ago I stumbled upon a YouTube video that would start off this whole
chain of events.

This seriously is an amazing video and I recommmend giving it a watch. It's a
great introduction to the world of custom keyboards and the rabbit hole that
comes with it.

# Configuring the Keyboard with QMK

The most common firmware for custom keyboards are [QMK](https://qmk.fm/) and
[ZMK](https://zmkfirmware.dev/). QMK is the most popular firmware for custom
wire keyboards, while ZMK is a newer firmware that supports wireless keyboards.
Because I'm using a wired keyboard, I'll be using QMK.
