I've ditched my traditional keyboard for a split keyboard. Here's why I made the
switch and how I'm finding it so far.

# Why?

A few months ago I stumbled upon a YouTube video that would start off this whole
chain of events.

This seriously is an amazing video and I recommmend giving it a watch. It's a
great introduction to the world of custom keyboards and the rabbit hole that
comes with it.

# The Piantor Keyboard: [My Choice](https://shop.beekeeb.com/product/pre-soldered-piantor-split-keyboard/)

- **42 keys**: This seemed like a good balance of portability and compactness with
  enough fumctionality overlap with a standard full-sized QWERTY keyboard that
  would make the board(s) super east to tae around and make it so that when I did
  need to use a full-sized keyboard, I wouldn't be completely lost.
- **wired**: I wanted a wired keyboard to avoid the hassle of charging and from the
  research I did, it seems that wired keyboards are more reliable than wireless

## Configuring the Keyboard with QMK

The most common firmware for custom keyboards are [QMK](https://qmk.fm/) and
[ZMK](https://zmkfirmware.dev/). QMK is the most popular firmware for custom
wire keyboards, while ZMK is a newer firmware that supports wireless keyboards.
Because I'm using a wired keyboard, I'll be using QMK.

# Conclusion: Is it Worth It?

It depends. If you're looking for a new hobby and are willing to spend a lot of
time and money on a keyboard, then I think it could potentially be a good choice.
Personally, I love the uniqueness of the board, the customization options, and
overall the smoothness and tactility of the experience. Just from the short time
that I have been using this board I've noticed:

- My touch typing has significantly improved
- 0 wrist pain
- Much more enjoyable typing experience overall (some "shiny object syndrome" is
  definitely at play too here)
