part of my design course requirements at Rice University, I will be creating\na game in a group of 4 (and more!) using the Godot engine\nover the upcoming semester. This blog post will serve as a progress log for\nthe game's development and hopefully provide some good insights into the game\ndevelopment process from someone who has never made a game before.\nInitial Project Proposal\nNot to give too much away yet, but our game is called 43 Monkeys and draws\na lot of inspiration from this news source:\nWhat we know after 43 monkeys escaped a South Carolina research facility\n\n\n  \n  \n  \n    A teaser image of our game idea from our initial project proposal.\n  \n  \n\nGame Description\nIn 43 Monkeys, the player controls a group of monkeys that have escaped from\na research facility. The monkeys must navigate through a series of puzzles and\nobstacles to escape the facility and make it to freedom on the outside. Along\nthe way they can save more monkeys to add to their troop and use their unique\nabilities to solve puzzles and defeat enemies.\nGame Mechanics\nThe game is a keyboard-controlled top down 2D roguelike where the player\ncontrols both the main monkey and the troop that can follow the player or move\nindependently. Through 5 different levels/floors, the player must solve puzzles,\ndefeat enemies, and avoid traps to escape the facility. The player can also\ncollect power ups and new monkeys to add to their troop. Begin a rogue-like, the\ngame will have perma-death, but the player can unlock shortcuts and new\nabilities to make future runs easier.\n\n  \n  \n  \n    A snapshot of gameplay from the finished second level of the game.\n  \n  \n\n\nProgress Log\nThe following sections document the incremental progress we made over the\nsemester from a small MVP from winter break to the complete game at the end of\nthe spring semester.\nPre-Class Work\nBefore the class officially starts, we are taking time to familiarize ourselves\nwith the Godot engine and the basics of game development. My first thoughts on\nworking with GDScript is that it like a blend of Python and TypeScript, which is\npretty cool. I'm excited to see how it works in practice. I've also been\nwatching some tutorials on the Godot engine and game development in general\nto get a feel for the process.\nAs of now, we have basic character sprites and background tiles ready to go.\nWe are also working getting a basic scene set up in Godot to start testing\nout movement and interactions. Godot's\ndocumentation is very\ngood and has been a great resource for getting started.\nOverview of Godot\nAt the most basic level, creating games in Godot revolves around four major\nconcepts: (1) scenes, (2) nodes, (3) the scene tree, and (4)\nsignals. As the documentation says:\n\n\"In Godot, a game is a tree of nodes that you group together into scenes.\nYou can then wire these nodes so they can communicate using signals.\"\n\nEvery component of a Godot game is broken down into reusable assets called\nscenes. Even though the name may make you think that a scene is a complete\nlevel or screen, pretty much any element in your game can be its own scene,\nwhether it's a character, button, light source, etc. Godot will store these files\nas *.tscn files containing information about resource dependencies, metadata,\nand more. For example, here's the visual editor view of our game's eventual\nlevel_1.tscn file:\n\n  \n  \n  \n    Level 1 scene in the Godot editor\n  \n  \n\nThis brings us to both the scene tree and nodes. On the left hand side\nof the image above you can see the scene tree, which has all of the scenes\nin the current scene. At the top is the scene root, in this case \"Level1\". Each\nscene is composed of one or more nodes, which are the building blocks of every\nscene. Godot defines a Node\nbase case from which all nodes inherit. All nodes have a name, editable\nproperties, callbacks to update every frame, can be extended with new properties\nand values, and they can be added as a child to another node. Together, nodes\nform a tree, and this is seen in the scene tree. Godot provides a massive\nlist of base node types that you can use and combine to create components\nout of the box.\n\nNOTE: You might have noticed that nodes and scenes look the same in\nthe editor. When you save a tree of nodes as a scene, it then shows as a single\nnode, with its internal structure hidden in the editor.\n\nNodes and scene are scriptable and can be changed to function programmatically.\nGodot has its own scripting language called GDScript that can be used; C++ is\nanother option as well.\nThe last major thing to mention is signals. Signals allow for nodes to alert\nother nodes of an event. For example, in the main menu, we have a start button\nthat, when pressed, transitions from the start screen to the level 1 transition:\n\n  \n  \n\nThis can be handled in the start_menu.gd script programmatically:\n\nFor a more complete breakdown of Godot, check out the documentation's\nOverview of Godot's key concepts.\nHandling Basic Movement\nNow that we have a big picture idea of how Godot operates, let's break down how\nwe achieve something as seemingly simple as a navigating our character sprite\naround the screen like this:\n\n  \n    \n    Your browser doesn't support the video tag, which I use in place of .gifs, and/or the video formats in use here\n    – sorry!\n  \n  \n  \n    Hurray movement!\n  \n  \n\nFirst we have a spritesheet for our monkey. A spritesheet an image of\nanimation cells arranged into rows and columns that we use to make up the\nindividual frames of our animation:\n\n  \n  \n  \n    Subsection of the spritesheet for the main monkey character.\n  \n  \n\nWe can create a new scene for the player and set the root node to be a\nCharacterBody2D, which is \"a 2D physics body specialized for characters\nmoved by script\"-- perfect! We then can add an AnimatedSprite2D to add our\nanimations from our spritesheet, and a CollisionShape2D node so that the\ncharacter can collide with the world.\nWhen we create a script for the scene, it will follow this format:\n\nFilling in more implementation, our final player.gd can be boiled down to\nthis:\n\nThis script handles WASD/arrow key input, normalizes diagonal movement,\nupdates animations, and moves the character with collision handling.\nFor a more detailed breakdown of how you can do this yourself, checking out\nthis official Godot guide\nfor animating 2D sprites.\nMusic\nWith a fun little open-source webapp called BeepBox,\nwe were able to make some fun 8-bit music for our game.\n\n  \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    Your browser does not support the audio element.\n  \n\n\nMaking an MVP Demo: Weeks 1-2\nWith the spring semester now in full swing and our team assembled, we are working\non getting our MVP (minimum viable product) ready for a demo scheduled at the end\nof week 2 of the course.\nOur big focus is looking at flocking\nalgorithms and\nboids. Boids (bird-oid objects) were\ndeveloped by Craig Reynolds in 1986 to simulate coordinated animal motion\nlike bird flocks or fish schools. The algorithm is based on three simple\nsteering behaviors:\n\nSeparation: Avoid crowding nearby flockmates\nAlignment: Steer towards the average heading of nearby flockmates\nCohesion: Steer towards the average position of nearby flockmates\n\nWe become interested in this concept because one of the unique features of\nour game is that the player will be able to control a group of monkeys that\nwill follow the player around the map or move independently as a swarm.\n\n  \n    \n    Your browser doesn't support the video tag, which I use in place of .gifs, and/or the video formats in use here\n    – sorry!\n  \n  \n\nThe boid.gd script implements these behaviors for enemy or NPC characters,\nwith additional features like wall avoidance and attacking. Below are key\nsnippets capturing the essence of the flocking logic:\n\nUpdate: Demo MVP is completed. We ended up doing a simple demo level where\nthe player has to use their group of monkeys to deactivate lasers with\ncoordinated button presses and defeat a boss at the end. I'm pretty proud of\nwhat we've been able to do some far in only a couple weeks of work, but we\nalso have a lot of work ahead of us as we figure out the rest of our levels,\npolished up the art, etc.\nSome more teasers\nLittle bit of the MVP demo in action:\n\n  \n    \n    Your browser doesn't support the video tag, which I use in place of .gifs, and/or the video formats in use here\n    – sorry!\n  \n  \n\nOur pretty epic main theme (if I do say so myself):\n\n  \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    Your browser does not support the audio element.\n  \n\n\nWork Until Midterm Demo: Weeks 3-7\nWith the initial demo out of the way, we are now working on fleshing out the\nrest of the game. This includes creating more levels, adding more mechanics,\nand polishing up the art and music. While our art was pretty good for the MVP,\nwe really want to dial in the aesthetic of the game to be something truly\nimpressive. Part of this is diving deeper into writing custom shaders and\nanimations to make the game feel more alive.\nAnother big thing that we realized post-demo is that our initial conception of\nthe game having procedurally generated levels might lead to unintended\nside effects. For example, troops could get stuck in walls or not be able to\ncomplete a level's required puzzle. Because of this, we are going to lean into\nmore curated levels that we can test and refine.\nShaders\nShaders have been another interesting challenge. The largest conceptual change\nis that the shader coding paradigm is much different than a traditional piece\nof code. Instead of writing a function that takes in some inputs and returns\nsome outputs, you are writing a function that takes in some inputs and modifies\nevery pixel individually. This is a very different way of thinking about\ncode and has been a fun challenge to wrap my head around. With just a little\nbit of work, we were able to create a simple VHS monitor-style shader that\nadds a cool wave effect to the screen when we are doing exposition cutscenes.\nFor a fantastic introduction to the world of shaders, I highly recommend\nchecking out The Book of Shaders.\nAdditionally, for Godot-specific shader help, the Godot\nShaders website has been a great resource for\nbuilding off the work of others.\nAdded Animations\nStayed tuned. I don't want to give away a lot but let's just say that\nwe've added some pretty cool animations to the game that make it feel much more\nalive.\nBoids: Revisited\nWe are making the boids much more interesting by adding targeting behavior to\nthem. Now, when the player is within their field of vision, they will target\nthe player and move towards them. This makes the game feel much more alive and\ndynamic. The player can hide behind walls to temporarily escape the boids' line\nsight, but the player has to now fend off the boids while trying to solve\npuzzles.\n\n2025-02-18 Progress Video\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n  \n\n\nMidterm Demo\nAs of time of writing this (03/04/2025), we are less than a week away from our\nmidterm demo. We have been working on adding a lot of aesthetic features to the\nlevels with an expanded tileset and lots of new light elements which have\ndramatically improved the look and feel of the game.\nWe're in the middle of polishing up the game for the upcoming demo and ironing\nout lingering bugs and issues. For a little sneak peek, I'll let Zach's trailer\nspeak for itself:\ngame trailer\nWrapping Up: Work Until Final Demo\nMidterm demo went well! We are now focused on creating the finished MVP of the\ngame that we can showcase in our final presentation and demo. The major areas of\nfocus are:\n\nFinish complete gameplay\nAdd more unique game elements and puzzles\nMore unique monkey variants, both in terms of design and their unique\nabilities, attacks, etc.\n\nWe are hoping that by the end of the semester we will have a fully-fledged MVP\nthat can be embedded in a browser to allow people to play, so stay tuned!\n\nPlay the Game on itch.io!\nThe game is now available for play on itch.io!\nPlay directly in your browser with the link below:\n\n    &lt;a href=\"https://alpha-prime-studios.itch.io/43-monkeys\"&gt;43 Monkeys by alpha prime studios | ⍺'&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\nContributors\nCore Developer Team\nNameLink(s)Role\nZach KepeGitHub Website LinkedInCore Developer\nGrant ThompsonLinkedInCore Developer\nKevin LeiLinkedInCore Developer\nMicah Kepe (me)GitHub Website LinkedInCore Developer\n\nOutside Collaborators\nNameLink(s)Role\nBospadSpotifyMusic Design\n\n\n    \n        Interested in contributing?

News stories like\nCognition AI's Devin,\nalbeit found to be categorically a\nhoax, have nonetheless\nfueled fears among software professionals about the future of their careers.\nHowever, the most current look at the state of AI in software development\nsuggests a more nuanced and hopeful future.\nThe AI Job Impact Narrative\nThe narrative that AI will replace programmers is not new. This idea has\npervaded movies, books, and news stories for decades dating back to the\nbeginnings of the first wave of AI research in the 1950s following the\nDartmouth Conference in 1956 (the event where the term \"artificial\nintelligence\" was first coined). In 1984, the Australian newspaper The Age\npublished an article entitled \"Researchers coming with some provocative\nhi-tech findings\", in which the author details the opinions of two Stanford University professors, Henry Levin and Russell Rumberger, who studied employment statistics and concluded that \"high technology is no panacea for unemployment... high technology will reduce the skills required by workers in the next decade because machines will do the work. Creativity and innovation by many individual workers will suffer.\" The article goes on to quote another Stanford computer science professor, Edward Feigenbaum, a prominent artificial intelligence researcher who at the time said:\n\n\"One of the worst pieces of advice you can give youngsters today is to\nbecome a computer programmer. Automation of software development will\ntake place in this decade and the 1990s.\"\n\nObviously, the likes of Bill Gates, Linus Torvalds, and countless other\nsoftware professionals who have made their careers in the decades since would\nbeg to differ. More recently, in 2018, McKinsey &amp; Company, a global\nmanagement consulting firm, predicted that 800 million jobs would be\nlost\nto automation by 2030. In countless media outlets since, the narrative has\nbeen repeated and amplified.\n\n  \n  \n  \n    Above: 1984 The Age Article on Artificial Intelligence\n  \n  \n\nThe proliferation of this narrative has led to widespread fear and\nuncertainty among software professionals. In 2019, Forbes published an\narticle\nthat cites a ZipRecruiter survey finding that \"One in five job seekers (one\nin three for those between the ages of 18 and 22) fear they will one day lose\ntheir job to AI.\" Fast forward to 2023, and a representative Gallup web poll\nof over 5,400 Americans found that 75% of respondents believe AI will reduce\nthe total number of jobs in the United States in the next 10 years.\n\n  \n  \n  \n    Above: The 2023 Gallup Poll on AI Job Impact\n  \n  \n\nHowever, we don't have to accept this narrative based solely on projections\nand surveys—- the data is in and the results are more optimistic than you\nmight think.\nThe Data is In\nAnnually, Stanford University's Human-Centered Artificial Intelligence (HAI)\nInstitute releases a report called the AI\nIndex. The AI Index is a comprehensive\nreport that tracks and measures the progress of AI research and development\nacross a variety of metrics. Here are some of the key takeaways from the 2024\nreport:\n\nAI makes workers more productive and leads to higher quality work.\n\n\n  \n  \n  \n    Above: Cross-study comparison of AI's impact on task completion\n        speed of Copilot users\n  \n  \n\n\"AI has been shown to enable workers to complete tasks more quickly and\nproduce higher quality work. A meta-review by Microsoft, which\naggregated studies comparing the performance of workers using Microsoft\nCopilot or GitHub’s Copilot LLM-based productivity-enhancing tools with those\nwho did not, found that Copilot users completed tasks in 26% to 73% less\ntime than their counterparts without AI access\" (AI Index, 2024, p. 272)\n\nAI is creating new jobs.\n\n\n  \n  \n  \n    Above: Private investment in AI by geographic area, 2023\n  \n  \n\n\"The United States once again led the world in terms of total AI private\ninvestment. In 2023, the $67.2 billion invested in the United States was\nroughly 8.7 times greater than the amount invested in the next highest country,\nChina (\\$7.8 billion), and 17.8 times the amount invested in the United Kingdom\n(\\$3.8 billion)\" (AI Index, 2024, p. 247)\n\"Consistent with trends in private investment, the United States leads all\nregions with 897 new AI companies, followed by China with 122, and the\nUnited Kingdom with 104.\" (AI Index, 2024, p. 251)\nA great recent blog post from Builder.io, a company that builds AI-powered\ntools for developers, also provides a comprehensive look\nat the current state of AI in the software industry and also seeks to dispel\nthe myth that AI will replace software professionals. The post states:\n\nBy automating routine tasks and augmenting human capabilities,\nAI tools are ushering in a new golden age of software engineering.\nDevelopers who adapt and leverage these tools will find themselves\nmore productive, more creative, and more valuable than ever before.\nThe future of software engineering isn't about competing with AI —\nit's about orchestrating it to build amazing things.\n\nThe U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics also provides a positive\noutlook\nfor the future of software development jobs, stating, \"Overall employment in\ncomputer and information technology occupations is projected to grow much\nfaster than the average for all occupations from 2022 to 2032. About\n377,500 openings are projected each year, on average, in these\noccupations due to employment growth and the need to replace workers who\nleave the occupations permanently.\"\nThe U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics data for employees in \"custom computer\nprogramming services\" from the Current Employment Statistics survey also\nshows a steady increase in employment over the past 10 years:\n\n  \n  \n  \n    Above: Employment, Hours, and Earnings from the Current Employment\n        Statistics survey (National)\n  \n  \n\nHistorical Precedent: The Rise of Spreadsheets\nIn the late 1970s, the accounting industry was on the brink of a\ntechnological revolution. Before the advent of electronic spreadsheets, the\naccounting industry relied heavily on manual calculations and paper-based\nrecord-keeping. Accountants, clerks, and bookkeepers spent countless hours\nporing over ledgers, meticulously ensuring every number added up. This\nlabor-intensive process was the norm for decades.\nThen came VisiCalc, the first spreadsheet program, launched in 1979. At\nfirst, many accountants were skeptical, even fearful. The idea that a piece\nof software could perform calculations and automate tasks traditionally done\nby hand was both revolutionary and terrifying. They worried about job\nsecurity and the potential devaluation of their skills.\nIn the book Leading Projects with Data, author Marcus Glowasz writes:\n\nNowadays, no accountant would imagine doing their work by hand, but back\nthen [in the late 1970s and early 1980s], many accountants were hesitant,\nfearing that these tools would make their jobs obsolete. And, to some\nextent, their fears were well-founded. Since 1980, around 400,000 accounting\nclerks have become obsolete as spreadsheets took over their role. But\nspreadsheets made accounting more effective and easier, which resulted in\n600,000 new jobs in the accounting industry. (Glowasz, 2022, p. 138-139)\n\nThe introduction of spreadsheets did indeed lead to the automation of many\ntasks previously done manually. However, it also created new opportunities\nand job roles that didn't exist before. By no longer having to spend hours on\ncalculations, accountants could focus on higher-level analysis, strategy, and\ndecision-making, leading to the emergent and lucrative roles of financial\nanalysts, controllers, and CFOs. The fear of job loss was replaced by a\nnewfound optimism and excitement for the future.\nOpinion: Enthusiasm for the Future\nPersonally, one of the more exciting pieces of news surrounding AI in the\npast year was the announcement of a new project from GitHub called GitHub\nCopilot Workspace.\nThis project aims to allow developers to write their tasks in natural\nlanguage and have Copilot generate the code systematically for them. As the\nblog post explains, the workflow for Copilot Workspace is as follows:\n\nWrite a task: Describe the task you want to accomplish in natural\nlanguage in a GitHub issue or new GitHub repository.\nWorkspace creates the plan: Copilot Workspace generates a step-by-step\nplan to accomplish the task. The plan is entirely editable and can be\ntweaked to fit your needs.\nExecute the plan: Copilot Workspace generates the code for each step\nin the plan. You can run the code in the workspace and edit it as needed\nuntil you are satisfied with the results. You can then create a pull\nrequest to merge the code into your project.\n\nThe implications of this project are vast in my mind. Using this tool\ndrastically lowers the barrier to entry for new developers-- you don't even\nneed to use an IDE as GitHub already has a web-based code editor. As the\narticle states, \"With Copilot Workspace we will empower more experienced\ndevelopers to operate as systems thinkers, and materially lower the barrier\nof entry for who can build software... we are accelerating to a near future\nwhere one billion people on GitHub will control a machine just as easily as\nthey ride a bicycle.\" If writing code becomes as easy as writing a natural\nlanguage description of the task, the possibilities for what can be built are\nendless. In the same vein as VisiCalc and the rise of spreadsheets, imagine\nthe lucrative new job roles that could emerge as programming's skill focus\nshifts from low-level syntax to high-level problem-solving and creativity.\nAs of the time of writing, Copilot Workspace is still only in limited\ntechnical preview, but projects like this serve to heighten my optimism and\nenthusiasm for the years to come in the software industry and the\naugmentation of our jobs as software professionals to greater creative\nfreedom and productivity.\nReferences\n\n1984 The Age Article on Artificial Intelligence\nMcKinsey &amp; Company 2018 AI Automation Post\nForbes 2019 AI Job Impact Article\n2023 Gallup Poll on AI Job Impact\nStanford HAI's 2024 AI Index Report\nGitHub Copilot Workspace Announcement\nBuilder.io Blog Post on AI Job Impact\nU.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics\nLeading Projects with Data\n\n","id":"https://micahkepe.com/blog/ai-job-impact/","title":"An Optimistic Take: AI's Augmentation of Software Professionals"},"https://micahkepe.com/blog/bloom-filters/":{"body":"In the realm of computer science, efficiency is often the key to solving complex\nproblems. One elegant solution that stands out for its efficiency is the Bloom\nfilter. Despite being relatively lesser-known, Bloom filters offer a powerful\nmethod for determining set membership while using minimal space. This post\nexplores what Bloom filters are, how they work, their applications in various\nfields, and compares them with other data structures.\nWhat is a Bloom Filter?\nA Bloom filter is a probabilistic data structure designed to efficiently test\nwhether an element is a member of a set. It can tell you if an element is\ndefinitely not in the set or that it might be in the set. This probabilistic\nnature makes Bloom filters incredibly space-efficient, but it also means they\ncome with a small chance of false positives.\n\n  \n  \n\n\nA Bloom filter consists of:\n\nA bit array of size $m$ (initially all bits are set to 0).\n$k$ independent hash functions, each of which maps an element to one of the\n$m$ array positions.\n\nHow Bloom Filters Work\nInsertion\nTo add an element to the Bloom filter, the element is passed through each of the\n$k$ hash functions, resulting in $k$ array positions. The bits at these\npositions in the bit array are set to 1. If any of these bits are already set to\n1, they remain unchanged.\n\n  \n  \n  \n    Above: Inserting an element into a Bloom filter\n  \n  \n\n\nQuerying\nTo check if an element is in the Bloom filter, the element is hashed using the\nsame $k$ hash functions to find the $k$ array positions. If all the\ncorresponding bits in the bit array are 1, the Bloom filter reports that the\nelement might be in the set. If any of the bits are 0, the element is definitely\nnot in the set.\n\n  \n  \n  \n    Above: Querying an element in a Bloom filter\n  \n  \n\n\nFalse Positives\nBloom filters do not store the actual elements, so they can never have false\nnegatives (i.e., reporting an element is not in the set when it actually is).\nHowever, they can have false positives (i.e., reporting an element is in the set\nwhen it is not). The probability of false positives depends on the size of the\nbit array $m$, the number of hash functions $k$, and the number of elements\ninserted $n$.\n\n  \n  \n  \n    Above: Example of a false positive in a Bloom filter\n  \n  \n\n\nMathematical Insight\nThe false positive probability $p$ can be approximated by:\n\\[ p \\approx \\left(1 - \\left(1 - \\frac{1}{m}\\right)^{kn}\\right)^k \\]\nFor practical use, choosing the optimal number of hash functions $k$ and the bit\narray size $m$ is crucial to minimize the false positive rate.\nComparing a Bloom Filter with a Hash Set in Python\nTo demonstrate the practical use of Bloom filters, let's consider a mock\nscenario where a Bloom filter is used to check if a URL is malicious. We will\ncompare Bloom filters and hash sets in terms of space efficiency and the ability\nto quickly determine if a URL is in the blacklist.\nMock Scenario: Checking Malicious URLs\nIn this scenario, we simulate a web browser that checks if a URL is malicious\nusing a locally stored Bloom filter or list. The Bloom filter offers a\nspace-efficient solution, reducing the need for frequent network calls.\n\nBloom Filter: Efficient in terms of space, but can have false positives.\nHash Set: No false positives, but can be memory-intensive.\n\nSetup and Explanation\nWe will simulate a scenario where we have 1 million URLs in a blacklist and\ncheck a large number of URLs to see if they are malicious. This will highlight\nthe space efficiency of Bloom filters compared to hash sets.\nBloom Filter\n\n    \n    \n\nHere's the results I got when running the Bloom filter simulation:\n\n  \n    \n      \n      \n        Bloom Filter Simulation Results\n\n      \n      \n    \n    \n      Bloom Filter Insertion Time: 3.457702159881592 seconds\nBloom Filter Query Time: 0.10877871513366699 seconds\nFalse Positives: 121\nMemory Usage: 1.14 MB\n\n    \n  \n\nHash Set\n\n    \n    \n\nHere's the results I got when running the hash set simulation:\n\n  \n    \n      \n      \n        Hash Set Simulation Results\n\n      \n      \n    \n    \n      Hash Set Insertion Time: 0.6073956489562988 seconds\nHash Set Query Time: 0.03299856185913086 seconds\nFalse Positives: 0\nMemory Usage: 30.15 MB\n\n    \n  \n\nAs you can see, the hash set is significantly more memory-intensive compared to\nthe Bloom filter (30.15 MB vs. 1.14 MB). However, it does not have any\nfalse positives and is faster in terms of insertion and querying times. But,\nimagine a scenario where the blacklist is much larger, and the memory usage\nbecomes a critical factor. This is where Bloom filters shine:\n\nMemory Efficiency: Bloom filters use a fixed amount of space regardless of\nthe number of items inserted, making them ideal for applications with limited\nmemory resources.\nScalability: As the size of the data set grows, the memory usage of a hash\nset grows linearly, whereas a Bloom filter's memory usage remains constant.\nThis makes Bloom filters suitable for very large data sets.\nNetwork Latency: By storing the Bloom filter locally, we can quickly\ndetermine if a URL might be malicious without frequent network calls, reducing\nlatency and improving user experience.\n\nPros and Cons of Bloom Filters\nPros\n\nSpace Efficiency: Bloom filters use minimal space compared to other data\nstructures.\nFast Set Membership Tests: Bloom filters offer constant-time set\nmembership tests.\nScalability: The memory usage of a Bloom filter remains constant\nregardless of the number of elements inserted.\nReduced I/O Operations: Bloom filters can reduce disk reads and network\ncalls by quickly filtering out non-existent elements.\n\n\nCons\n\nFalse Positives: Bloom filters can produce false positives, which may not\nbe acceptable in certain applications.\nOptimal Parameters: Choosing the optimal number of hash functions and bit\narray size is crucial for minimizing false positives.\nLimited Applications: Bloom filters are best suited for scenarios where\nfalse positives are acceptable and space efficiency is critical.\n\n\nReal-World Case Studies\nCase Study: Using Bloom Filters in Google Bigtable\nGoogle Bigtable, a distributed storage system for managing structured data, uses\nBloom filters to reduce disk lookups for non-existent rows or columns. By using\nBloom filters, Bigtable can quickly determine if a row or column is absent\nwithout accessing the disk, thereby improving read performance significantly.\nThis application of Bloom filters showcases their efficiency in handling\nlarge-scale data storage and retrieval systems.\nCase Study: Akamai's Content Delivery Network (CDN)\nAkamai, one of the largest CDNs in the world, uses Bloom filters to quickly\ndetermine if content is cached on their edge servers. By using Bloom filters,\nAkamai can minimize the number of cache misses and reduce the latency of serving\ncontent to users. This helps in delivering content more efficiently and improves\nthe overall performance of the CDN.\nCase Study: Medium Duplicate Story Detection\nMedium, a popular online publishing platform, uses Bloom filters to detect\nduplicate stories. When a user submits a new story, Medium checks if the story\nis a duplicate by querying a Bloom filter that stores the hashes of previously\nsubmitted stories. This helps in identifying and preventing the publication of\nduplicate content, ensuring a better user experience for readers.\nCase Study: Bitcoin's SPV Nodes\nIn Bitcoin, Simplified Payment Verification (SPV) nodes use Bloom filters to\ntrack transactions relevant to them without downloading the entire blockchain.\nBy using Bloom filters, SPV nodes can operate more efficiently with limited\nresources, making it feasible for lightweight clients to participate in the\nBitcoin network.\nConclusion\nBloom filters are a prime example of how probabilistic data structures can offer\npowerful solutions to space and time efficiency challenges. By understanding and\nimplementing Bloom filters, you can enhance the performance of your applications\nin scenarios where quick set membership tests are critical. Despite their\nsimplicity, Bloom filters have found their way into various sophisticated\nsystems and continue to be a valuable tool in a programmer's toolkit.\nReferences\n\nBloom Filters and SPV nodes within the bitcoin blockchain\nBloom Filter Wikipedia Page\nCloud Bigtable under the hood: How we improved single-row read throughput by 20-50%\nUniversity of Washington Lecture Slides on Bloom Filter Applications\nBloom Filters – Introduction and Implementation\nSystem Design: Bloom Filter\nBloom Filter Data Structure: Implementation and Application\n\n","id":"https://micahkepe.com/blog/bloom-filters/","title":"Bloom Filters: Space-Efficient Probabilistic Data Structures"},"https://micahkepe.com/blog/gitconfig/":{"body":"There's tons of little goodies you can add to your .gitconfig to make your\nlife easier. From hidden gems in the git Man pages to aliases and shell\nfunctions, here's a few things I've found useful to reduce friction in my Git\nworkflow.\nQuality of Life Improvements\nThese are some of the little things I've done that I think have contributed the\nmost to improving my experience with Git.\nVerbose Commit Context\nWhen you run git commit with no message specified, Git will open an editor\nwith a template that looks like this:\n\nAll lines starting with # will be ignored, so Git will not include them in\nyour commit message. By default, Git will just list what files you've changed\nand what branch you're on, but we can make it more verbose by adding a\ncommit.verbose setting to our .gitconfig:\n\nOr run:\n\nNow, when you run git commit, Git will include the file diffs as well at the\nend of the template so that you can see what exactly you're committing:\n\n  \n  \n  \n    Example of a Git commit with verbose output\n  \n  \n\nIntuitive Sorting and Listings of Branches and Tags\nBy default, Git comes with some not-so-sane defaults in my opinion for\ndisplaying branches and tags. But we can fix them!\nSorting Out Branches\nTwo flaws in the default sorting of branches:\n\n\nBranches are sorted alphabetically\n\n\nBranches are listed as a single column (no matter how many branches you have)\nSo if we have a ton of branches, we'll get output like this on git branch:\n\n\n\nTo fix (1) let's set branch.sort to -committerdate so that branches\nare sorted by their commit date:\n\nOr run git config --global branch.sort -committerdate.\nNow, when you run git branch, we'll get our branches sorted with the most\nrecently modified at the top.\nTo fix (2), let's set column.ui to auto so that branches are listed as a\ncolumn:\n\nOr run git config --global column.ui auto.\nNow, when you run git branch, we'll get our branches listed as a column:\n\nSorting Out Tags\nSince tags are also sorted alphabetically by default, if you run git tag\nyou'll get non intuitive listings for your tags:\n\nInstead, let's set tag.sort to version:refname so that tags are sorted by\ntheir version number:\n\nOr run git config --global tag.sort -version:refname.\n\nNote: The - in front of version:refname is to reverse the sort order so\nthat the most recent tags are listed first. You can omit it if you want the\ntags to be sorted in ascending order.\n\nNow, when you run git tag, you'll get a nicely sorted list of tags:\n\n\nPrettier Diffs with diff-so-fancy\nBy default, Git will show you diffs in a very compact form chalk full of @#$%!\nsymbols that are hard to read, especially when you have a lot of cross file\nchanges:\n\n  \n  \n  \n    Example of a Git diff with a lot of cross file changes\n  \n  \n\nInstead, let's use diff-so-fancy\nto make your git diff look like it deserves a frame.\nHere's how to set it up:\n\n\nInstall diff-so-fancy with the package manager of your choice. For example,\nif you're using Homebrew, run brew install diff-so-fancy. Check the GitHub\nrepo for other installation options.\n\n\nUpdate your core.pager and interactive.diffFilter settings to use\ndiff-so-fancy instead of the default less pager:\n\n\n\n\n  \n  \n  \n    Example of a Git diff with a lot of cross file changes using diff-so-fancy\n  \n  \n\nBonus: Change the Diff Algorithm\nBy default, Git uses a diff algorithm called patience diff, but it's not the\nonly algorithm out there. Personally, I have changed my default diff algorithm\nto histogram, which in some cases leads to a more readable diff.\nTo change the diff algorithm, run:\n\nOr add the following to your .gitconfig:\n\nThe difference is not huge, but it's worth it if you're looking for a more\nreadable diff on certain edge cases.\nRebasing on Pull Conflicts\nThis one might be a smidge controversial, but I personally like rebasing on pull\nconflicts as it keeps the commit history clean without all the extra \"Merge\nbranch 'main' into 'main'\" commits.\nWe can enable rebase on pull conflicts with:\n\nOr run:\n\nNow, instead of a messy merge commit, git pull rewrites your local changes on\ntop of the updated upstream branch.\nSetting Your Editor\nWhen you run a command that opens an editor, like git commit with no message\nspecified, it will open an editor (default is usually vi, which is fine\nif you're stuck in 1975).\n\n  \n    \n      \n      \n        Note on Editor Variable Precedence\n\n      \n      \n    \n    \n      You can also set the editor with the GIT_EDITOR environment variable, which\nhas greater precedence than the core.editor configuration option:\nFrom the git-var(1) man page:\n\n\n\nHowever, it probably makes more sense if for whatever reason you do not want to\nset the editor in your .gitconfig, you could set it with the VISUAL\nenvironment variable instead since it will work with most other programs as\nwell.\n\n    \n  \n\nGo ahead and set your editor to nvim (or emacs if you're a weirdo).\nAutomatically Setup Remote Repositories\nHow many times have you been pushing a new branch to a remote resository and you\nare hit with a wall of text telling you to run git push --set-upstream origin &lt;branch&gt; and then git push again? Let's make it so that you never have to\nsee this again:\nIn your .gitconfig, add the following:\n\nOr run:\n\nNow, when you run git push, Git will automatically set up the remote\nrepository for you.\n\nOptimizations and Maintenance\nWith very little effort, we can cash in on performance boosts and disk space\nsavings.\nMaintenance Scheduling\nGit’s maintenance tasks optimize repository size and performance by running\ntasks like garbage collection and repacking.1,2 You can enable automatic\nmaintenance to run in the background:\n\nOr run:\n\nThis sets up a cron-like job to periodically optimize your repositories,\nreducing disk usage and improving performance. It’s a \"set it and forget it\"\nfeature, perfect for keeping your repositories lean without manual intervention.\nCompression\nTo reduce repository size, I set Git’s compression to the maximum level (9):\n\nOr run:\n\nValues range from -1 (default, platform-dependent) to 9 (maximum compression).\nHigher compression saves space but takes slightly longer. Since my worktrees are\nsmall, the tradeoff is worth it.\n\nGit Shortcuts with Aliases\nThere's two types of aliases that I use: Git-defined and shell-defined. Git\naliases are defined in the .gitconfig file, while shell aliases are defined\nin the shell's configuration file.\nGit Aliases\nGit aliases are defined in the .gitconfig file and are prefixed with git &lt;alias&gt;.\nIn .gitconfig:\n\n\n\ngraphis a Git alias that shows a graph of your commit history with one\ncommit per line instead of the default, which I think is very cluttered. Run\nwithgit graph to see it in action.\n\n\nl will pretty print your commit history with a custom format. I stole this\none from a coworker and never looked back. Run with git l.\n\n\nignore is so I can quickly add a bunch of files to my .gitignore file. I\nalready was using gitignore.io\nall the time to generate my .gitignore files, so I figured I'd just add a\nlittle helper function to my .gitconfig to make it easier. This one does\nrequire an internet connection since it fetches the response via curl.\n\nThe ! at the beginning of the function tells Git to run it as a shell\ncommand rather than a Git built-in command.\n\nNow I can run ignore and it will fetch the response from gitignore.io:\n\n\n\n\n  \n    \n      \n      \n        Note on $* Expansion\n\n      \n      \n    \n    \n      This is not directly related to Git, but I had fun figuring out how to do\nthis with my ignore alias.\nThis script originally came from the gitignore.io Command Line\nDocs,\nbut they use the $@ variable instead of $* for the language list:\n\nThe $@ variable is a special variable in Bash that expands to all the\narguments/ fields passed. However, the fields are separated by spaces, which\nmeans that for the original script, the language list necessarily had to\nstrictly comma-separated without spaces like this:\n\nThis because it passes the arguments to the curl command and the request\nexpects them to be separated by commas.\nHowever, I didn't like this inflexibility, so I changed the script to use $*\ninstead of $@. $* is another special variable that expands to all the fields\npassed BUT with a special internal field separator variable, IFS, which is\nspace by default. So, if we locally set IFS to a comma, we can pass the\nlanguage list as a space-separated list as well and get the same result:\n\nNow we have the same request sent but with the flexibility to pass a space-\nseparated list and/or a comma-separated list.\n\n    \n  \n\nShell Aliases\nNext up are all of my Git-related shell aliases. While you could define these\nin your .gitconfig, I prefer to define them in my shell's configuration file\nto make them shorter since we can forgo the git prefix and use two or three\nletters instead.\n\nBash/Zsh\nIn ~/.bashrc or ~/.zshrc:\n\n\nAnd for my fellow Fish users:\n\nFish\n~/.config/fish/config.fish:\n\n\nEverything is a mneumonic so it's easy to remember:\n\nga for 'git add'\ngc for 'git commit'\ngd for 'git diff'\ngl for 'git log'\ngp for 'git push'\ngcl for 'git clone'\n...\n\nI'll admit, \"gu\" for git pull breaks this pattern since \"gp\" is already taken\nby git push, but I think of it as 'git update'.\nThe alias for git status --short is something I stole from the codingjerk\nYouTube channel3. What I like about\nthis is that the normal git status command just gives too much information and\nwhen I just want to quickly see modified files, it fills up nearly the entire\nvertical space of my terminal.\nDefault git status output:\n\n(I think after the thousandth time I've used git status, I got the point that\nI can add files to the staging area with git add.)\nWith git status --short:\n\nI also recommend setting status.branch = true to show the branch name in the\nstatus output, even if you are using the --short flag:\n\nOr run:\n\n\nGPG Signing: Verifying You and Your Commits\nWant that sweet little “Verified” badge on your commits? You’ll need to set up\nGPG signing.\nGPG (GNU Privacy Guard) is an open-source implementation of the PGP (Pretty\nGood Privacy) standard. It lets you encrypt, decrypt, and—most relevant\nhere—sign things to prove they came from you.\nWhen you generate a GPG key, you get two keys:\n\nPublic key — Share this with the world. Others use it to verify your\nsignature or send you encrypted messages.\nPrivate key — Keep this secret. It proves your identity when signing\nthings (like commits). Don’t lose it. Don’t leak it.\n\nSigning Commits with GPG\nHere’s the basic flow to get going:\n\n\nGenerate a key\nRun:\n\nPick the defaults unless you know what you’re doing.\n\n  \n    \n      \n      \n        Installing GPG on macOS\n\n      \n      \n    \n    \n      If you're on macOS, you'll want to install gpg with Homebrew:\n\nAfter installing, we'll need to let Git know which GPG binary to use.\nIn your .gitconfig, add this:\n\nOr run:\n\n\n    \n  \n\n\n\nList your GPG key ID\nRun:\n\nGrab the long key ID (XXXXXXXXYYYYZZZZ) for the next step.\n\n\nTell Git to use it\nAdd this to your Git config:\n\n\n\nAdd your public key to GitHub\nExport your public key:\n\nThen go to https://github.com/settings/gpg/new,\npaste it in, and you’re set.\n\n\nNow when you commit and push, GitHub will show a \"Verified\" badge if everything\nlines up.\n\nOn macOS, you might want to install GPG Suite for\nbetter integration.\n\nBonus: Email Signing\nGPG isn’t just for Git—you can use it to sign emails too. Clients like NeoMutt\nor Mutt support this, though fair warning: it’ll attach your public key to every\nmessage, which might not be your vibe. I don’t use this personally, but it’s\nthere if you want it.\n\nMiscellaneous Goodies\nHere's a collection of some small tweaks that you can brag to your coworkers\nabout.\nRerere\nI know what you're thinking, \"What the hell does that even mean?\"\n\"Rerere\" stands for \"reuse recorded resolution\". Again this is still\na little mysterious, but we can see from the git-rerere(1) man page:\n\n\n\nIn English: When you have resolved a conflict in the past, git rerere will\nkeep track of the resolution and apply it to future conflicts.\nResolve a conflict once, and rerere saves it.

They are the invisible forces that power our\nmodern world, from the search engines we use to find information to the social\nnetworks we use to connect with friends and family. In this post, I share some\ningenious algorithms that I have learned about both in courses and through my\nown research.\n1. PageRank\nWhen Larry Page and Sergey Brin founded Google in 1998, they revolutionized the\nway we search for information on the internet. Their search engine, Google\nSearch, used a clever algorithm called PageRank to rank web pages based on their\nimportance and relevance to a user's query. While Google has since developed\nmore sophisticated algorithms, PageRank remains a fundamental part of their\nsearch engine and understanding how it works can help you better understand how\nsearch engines work.\nHistory of PageRank\nThe idea for PageRank came to Larry Page in a dream in 1996 while he was a\ngraduate student at Stanford University. Page was interested in the problem of\nranking web pages based on their importance and relevance to a user's query. He\nrealized that the structure of the web could be used to infer the importance of\na page, just like the structure of academic citations could be used to infer the\nimportance of a research paper.\nPage and his advisor, Terry Winograd, began working on a prototype search engine\ncalled BackRub that used a simple version of PageRank to rank web pages. BackRub\nwas named after its ability to analyze the \"back links\" pointing to a given web\npage. Page and Winograd presented their work at the Seventh International World\nWide Web Conference in 1998, where it was well received by the academic\ncommunity.\nAfter the conference, Page teamed up with his friend Sergey Brin to turn BackRub\ninto a commercial search engine. They renamed the search engine Google (a play\non the word \"googol\", which means 1 followed by 100 zeros) and incorporated\nPageRank as a key part of their ranking algorithm. The rest, as they say, is\nhistory.\nHow PageRank Works\nPageRank is based on the idea that a web page's importance can be measured by\nthe number and quality of other pages that link to it. In other words, if many\nimportant pages link to a particular page, then that page must also be\nimportant. Mathematically, PageRank can be expressed as:\n\n  \n    \n      \n      \n        PageRank Formal Definition\n\n      \n      \n    \n    \n      \\[ PR(p_i) = \\frac{1-d}{N} + d \\sum_{p_j \\in M(p_i)} \\frac{PR(p_j)}{L(p_j)} \\]\nwhere:\n\n$PR(p_i)$ is the PageRank of page $p_i$\n$N$ is the total number of pages\n$d$ is a damping factor (usually set to 0.85), which represents the\nprobability that a random surfer will continue clicking on links rather than\njumping to a random page\n$M(p_i)$ is the set of pages that link to $p_i$\n$L(p_j)$ is the number of outgoing links from page $p_j$\n\n\n    \n  \n\n\nThe damping factor $d$ is used to prevent pages with many incoming links\n(\"sinks\") from having disproportionately high PageRank values since they have no\noutgoing links. Without the damping factor, the PageRank values would tend to\nconcentrate on a small number of pages, leading to a skewed ranking of search\nresults. You can think of the damping factor as a way to model the behavior of a\nrandom surfer who occasionally jumps to a random page instead of following links\n(after a certain number of clicks, the surfer gets bored and jumps to a random\npage).\nTo calculate PageRank, the algorithm starts by assigning an initial PageRank\nvalue to each page (usually $1/N$). Then, it iteratively updates the PageRank\nvalues using the above equation until convergence. The final PageRank values\nrepresent the importance of each page.\nFor example, consider a simple network of 4 web pages: A, B, C, and D. Suppose\npage B has a link to page A, page C has a link to page A, and page D has links\nto all three pages like so:\n\n  \n  \n  \n    Above: Simple network of 4 web pages: A, B, C, and D\n  \n  \n\nInitially, each page is assigned a PageRank of 0.25. After one iteration, page\nA's PageRank is updated as follows:\n\n  \n    \n      \n      \n        PageRank Iteration 1 Update\n\n      \n      \n    \n    \n      \\[ PR(A) = \\frac{1-0.85}{4} + \\]\n\\[0.85 \\left( \\frac{PR(B)}{1} + \\frac{PR(C)}{1} +\n\\frac{PR(D)}{3} \\right) \\]\n\\[= 0.0375 + 0.85 \\left(\\frac{0.25}{1} + \\frac{0.25}{1} - \\frac{0.25}{3}\\right) \\]\n\\[\\boxed{ PR(A) \\approx 0.46 }\\]\n\n    \n  \n\nAfter several iterations, the PageRank values converge to stable values that\nreflect the importance of each page in the network. The final PageRank values\ncan then be used to rank the pages in search results.\n\n  \n  \n  \n    Above: PageRank GIF showing the iterative calculation of\n        PageRank values for a simple network of web pages\n  \n  \n\nOne interesting property of PageRank is that it is a Markov chain, which means\nthat the PageRank values can be interpreted as the probability of a random\nsurfer landing on a particular page after clicking on links for a long time.\nThis interpretation has led to some interesting applications of PageRank beyond\nweb search, such as modeling the spread of disease or analyzing the structure of\nsocial networks.\nFun Facts about PageRank\n\nThe original PageRank algorithm was inspired by the way academic papers are\ncited by other papers. Just as an academic paper's importance can be measured\nby the number and quality of papers that cite it, a web page's importance can\nbe measured by the number and quality of pages that link to it.\nIn the early days of Google, the PageRank algorithm was run on a cluster of\ncheap Linux computers. On display at Stanford University is the original\nGoogle server rack, made from Lego bricks.\nPageRank has been used to rank everything from web pages to scientific papers\nto social media influencers. In fact, there are even \"PageRank for people\"\nalgorithms that try to measure the importance and influence of individuals\nbased on their social connections.\n\n\n2. Spell Checkers\nHave you ever wondered how spell checkers work? How do they know when you've\nmisspelled a word and suggest the correct spelling? The answer lies in a clever\nalgorithm called the Levenshtein distance algorithm.\nHistory of Spell Checkers\nThe history of spell checkers dates back to the early days of computing. In\n1957, a team of researchers at Bell Labs developed a program called\n\"TypoCorrect\" that could detect and correct typing errors in text. However,\nTypoCorrect was limited to a small vocabulary and could only correct errors that\nwere one letter off from the correct spelling.\nIn the 1960s and 1970s, researchers began to develop more sophisticated spell\ncheckers that could handle larger vocabularies and more complex errors. One of\nthe first practical spell checkers was developed by Ralph Gorin at Stanford\nUniversity in 1971. Gorin's spell checker used a dictionary of 10,000 words and\ncould suggest corrections for misspelled words.\nIn the 1980s, spell checkers became more widely available as part of word\nprocessing software. The first spell checker for the IBM PC was developed by\nMark Skapinker and released in 1981. Microsoft Word, which was first released in\n1983, included a built-in spell checker that quickly became a standard feature\nof word processing software.\nToday, spell checkers are ubiquitous and can be found in everything from email\nclients to social media apps. Modern spell checkers use sophisticated algorithms\nand machine learning techniques to detect and correct spelling errors in\nreal-time.\nHow Spell Checkers Work\nAt the core of most spell checkers is the Levenshtein distance algorithm, which\nmeasures the similarity between two strings. The Levenshtein distance between\ntwo strings is defined as the minimum number of single-character edits\n(insertions, deletions, or substitutions) required to transform one\nstring into the other.\nFor example, the Levenshtein distance between \"kitten\" and \"sitting\" is 3,\nbecause we can transform \"kitten\" into \"sitting\" with the following edits:\n\nkitten → sitten (substitution of \"s\" for \"k\")\nsitten → sittin (substitution of \"i\" for \"e\")\nsittin → sitting (insertion of \"g\" at the end)\n\nThe Levenshtein distance algorithm can be implemented using dynamic programming.\nLet $d(i, j)$ be the Levenshtein distance between the first $i$ characters of\nstring $s_1$ and the first $j$ characters of string $s_2$. Then, $d(i, j)$ can\nbe calculated using the following recurrence relation:\n\n  \n    \n      \n      \n        Levenshetin Distance Recurrence Relation\n\n      \n      \n    \n    \n      $$\nd(i, j) =\n\\begin{cases}\n\\max(i, j) &amp; \\text{if } \\min(i, j) = 0 \\newline\n\\min \\begin{cases}\nd(i-1, j) + 1 \\newline\nd(i, j-1) + 1 \\newline\nd(i-1, j-1) + 1*{s_1[i] \\neq s_2[j]}\n\\end{cases} &amp; \\text{otherwise}\n\\end{cases}\n$$\nwhere $1*{s_1[i] \\neq s_2[j]}$ is an indicator function that is 1 if the $i$-th\ncharacter of $s_1$ is not equal to the $j$-th character of $s_2$, and 0\notherwise.\n\n    \n  \n\nTo check the spelling of a word, a spell checker typically compares the word to\na dictionary of correctly spelled words using the Levenshtein distance\nalgorithm. If the Levenshtein distance between the word and its closest match in\nthe dictionary is below a certain threshold, the spell checker assumes the word\nis correctly spelled. Otherwise, it suggests the closest match(es) as possible\ncorrections.\nOne interesting variant of the Levenshtein distance algorithm is the\nDamerau-Levenshtein distance, which allows for transpositions of adjacent\ncharacters in addition to insertions, deletions, and substitutions. This variant\nis useful for catching common typing errors like \"teh\" instead of \"the\".\nFun Facts about Spell Checkers\n\nThe first spell checker was developed for the Unix operating system and was\ncalled \"spell\". It used a simple algorithm that compared each word to a\ndictionary of correctly spelled words.\nEarly spell checkers were notoriously bad at handling proper nouns and\ntechnical jargon. Modern spell checkers use more sophisticated techniques,\nsuch as machine learning, to improve their accuracy.\nSome spell checkers can even catch homophones (words that sound the same but\nare spelled differently), such as \"their\" vs. \"there\" vs. \"they're\".\nSpell checkers have been used for more than just correcting spelling errors.\nIn 2018, researchers at the University of Michigan developed a spell checker\nthat could detect signs of Alzheimer's disease in writing samples by looking\nfor subtle changes in language use over time.\nThe Levenshtein distance algorithm has applications beyond spell checking,\nsuch as DNA sequence alignment and plagiarism detection.\n\n\n3. Shazam\nHave you ever heard a song playing and wondered what it was called or who sang\nit? Shazam is a popular app that can identify songs based on a short audio clip.\nThe algorithm behind Shazam is ingenious in its simplicity and effectiveness.\nHistory of Shazam\nThe idea for Shazam came to co-founder Chris Barton in 1999 when he was a\nstudent at the University of California, Berkeley. Barton was at a bar with\nfriends and heard a song he liked but didn't know the name of. He thought it\nwould be great if there was a way to identify songs using a phone.\nBarton teamed up with Avery Wang, a PhD student in audio signal processing, to\ndevelop the algorithm behind Shazam. Wang had previously worked on a system for\nidentifying bird songs based on their spectrograms, and he realized that a\nsimilar technique could be used to identify music.\nBarton and Wang founded Shazam in 2000 and launched the first version of the app\nin 2002. At the time, the app could only identify a small number of songs and\nrequired users to call a special phone number and hold their phone up to the\nmusic. However, the app quickly gained popularity and began to expand its\ndatabase of songs.\nIn 2008, Shazam launched an iPhone app that allowed users to identify songs\ndirectly from their phone. This version of the app used the phone's built-in\nmicrophone to capture the audio and send it to Shazam's servers for\nidentification. The iPhone app was a huge success and helped to drive Shazam's\ngrowth.\nToday, Shazam is one of the most popular music recognition apps in the world,\nwith over 1 billion downloads and 20 million song identifications per day. In\n2018, Shazam was acquired by Apple for a reported $400 million.\nHow Shazam Works\nAt a high level, Shazam works by converting an audio clip into a \"fingerprint\"\nthat can be compared to a database of known songs. The fingerprint is created\nusing a clever algorithm called the spectrogram peak finding algorithm.\nHere's how it works:\n\nThe audio clip is divided into short overlapping segments (called \"frames\")\nand the frequency spectrum of each frame is calculated using the Fast Fourier\nTransform (FFT).\nThe spectrogram (a visual representation of the frequency spectrum over time)\nis analyzed to identify \"peaks\" (local maxima) in the frequency domain. These\npeaks correspond to the dominant frequencies in the audio clip.\nThe time and frequency coordinates of each peak are combined to create a\n\"hash\" (a unique identifier) for that peak.\nThe hashes for all the peaks in the clip are combined to create a fingerprint\nfor the clip.\nThe fingerprint is compared to a database of fingerprints for known songs\nusing a technique called \"combinatorial hashing\".\nIf a match is found, the song is identified and returned to the user.\n\nThe key insight behind Shazam is that the spectrogram peaks are robust to noise\nand distortion, so they can be used to identify songs even in noisy environments\nor when the audio quality is poor.\n\n  \n  \n  \n    Above: Spectrogram of 'Blurred Lines' by Robin Thicke.\n  \n  \n\nFor example, suppose you're at a noisy bar and hear a song playing that you want\nto identify. You open up Shazam and record a 10-second clip of the song. Shazam\nthen converts the clip into a spectrogram and identifies the peaks.\nThe peaks are then hashed and combined into a fingerprint, which is compared to\nShazam's database of over 11 million songs. Even though the clip is noisy and\ndistorted, Shazam is still able to find a match and identify the song.\n\n  \n  \n  \n    Above: Signal matching in Shazam.\n  \n  \n\nOne interesting aspect of Shazam's algorithm is that it uses a technique called\n\"combinatorial hashing\" to efficiently search its database of song fingerprints.\nCombinatorial hashing works by dividing the fingerprint into smaller\nsubfingerprints and searching for matches for each subfingerprint separately.\nThis allows Shazam to identify songs quickly even though its database contains\nmillions of songs.\n\n  \n  \n  \n    Above: Excerpt from Shazam's patent showing the process of\n        identifying a song.\n  \n  \n\n\nFun Facts about Shazam\n\nShazam's database contains over 11 million songs and is growing every day.\nShazam has been used to identify over 50 billion songs since its launch\nin 2002.\nThe most Shazamed song of all time is \"Dance Monkey\" by Tones and I, which has\nbeen identified over 36.6 million times.\nShazam's algorithm can identify a song in as little as 1 second, even if the\naudio quality is poor or there is background noise.\nShazam's co-founder Avery Wang is also an accomplished classical pianist and\nhas performed at Carnegie Hall.\n\n\nConclusion\nThese are just a few examples of the many ingenious algorithms that power our\nmodern world. From search engines to spell checkers to music recognition apps,\nalgorithms are all around us, working behind the scenes to make our lives easier\nand more efficient. As technology continues to advance, we can expect to see\neven more clever algorithms emerge to solve new problems and challenges.\nThe next time you use a search engine to find information, correct a spelling\nmistake, or identify a song, take a moment to appreciate the algorithms that\nmake it all possible. They may be invisible, but they are the unsung heroes of\nthe digital age.\nReferences\n\nLarry Page's University of Michigan commencement address\nGoogle’s PageRank: The Math Behind the Search Engine\nThe Anatomy of a Large-Scale Hypertextual Web Search Engine\nPageRank GIF Source\nThe Levenshtein-Damerau Distance\nShazam: An Industrial-Strength Audio Search Algorithm\nHow on Earth Does Shazam Recognize Songs\nHow does Shazam Uniquely Identify A Track?\n\n","id":"https://micahkepe.com/blog/ingenious-algorithms/","title":"Ingenious Algorithms We Take for Granted: PageRank, Spell Checkers, and Shazam"},"https://micahkepe.com/blog/minishell/":{"body":"In a little over 100 lines of Rust code, we can build a simple shell program\nthat can execute commands, supports piping, handles signals, and maintains\ncommand history. This tutorial will guide you through the process of creating\na minimal shell, which we will call \"minishell\", using Rust's powerful standard\nlibrary and some external crates.\nWhat is a Shell?\nNo doubt you've used a shell before, whether it be the Windows Command Prompt,\nPowerShell, or a Unix shell like Bash or Zsh. A shell is a command-line\ninterface that lets users interact with their operating system, whether it be\nfile management, starting processes, or something else. The \"shell\" in a shell\nprogram refers to the fact that the shell is a wrapper around the operating\nsystem's functionality via the kernel's APIs.\nAt its core, the lifecycle of a shell can be summarized as follows1:\n\nRead: The shell reads a command from the user.\nParse: It parses the command to understand what needs to be done.\nExecute: The shell executes the command, which may involve running a\nprogram, executing a script, or performing some other action.\nOutput: The shell displays the output of the command to the user.\n\nRecognizing this, we can see that if we want to build a shell, we need a way\nto continuously prompt the user for input, parse that input, and then hand\noff the parsed commands to the operating system to execute. With this\nas our starting point, we can begin building our shell.\nLet's first start by creating a new Rust project for our shell:\n\nNext, navigate to the main.rs file in the src directory and open it in your\ntext editor of choice.\nPrompting for Input\nSince our shell will be a command-line interface, we need to prompt the user\nfor input and read that input. In Unix-like systems, this is typically done\nfrom the \"stdin\" (standard input) stream. In Rust, we can make use the std::io\nmodule to read input from the user. Let's start with just a basic loop:\n\nThere are several important things to note here:\n\nWe use print! instead of println! to avoid a newline after the prompt.\nWe call io::stdout().flush() to ensure the prompt is displayed immediately\nbefore reading input. Without this, the default buffering behavior may\ndelay the prompt until after the user has entered input, which is not\nwhat we want.\nWe read a line of input from the user using io::stdin().read_line(). This\nreturns a Result that either contains the number of bytes read (which\nwe ignore here) or an error.\n\nTo run this code, you can use the cargo run command in your terminal:\n\nParsing Input\nAlright, so now we can take input from the user, but we need to parse that input\ninto commands that we can execute.\nFor our basic naive shell, we'll split the input into words separated by\nwhitespace (don't worry, we'll improve this later), where the first word is the\ncommand and the remaining words are arguments. Let's update our code to handle\nthis:\n\nNow when we enter a command like ls -la, the shell will parse it into:\n\nObviously, this is very basic parsing, and it doesn't handle multiple commands\nand/or piping, but we will fix that later. For now, we have a basic shell that\ncan read input from the user and parse that input into a command and its\narguments.\nExecuting Commands\nWe now have a basic shell that can read input from the user and parse that\ninput into a sequence of commands that can be executed by spawning new\nprocesses. However, not all commands are equally handled by the shell, leading\nto the need for built-in commands and understanding how shells create processes.\nHow Shells Create Process\nBefore we execute commands, I think a little background on how shells create\nprocesses is in order. When a shell executes a command, it typically does so\nby creating a new process, a process being an instance of a running program.\nIn Unix-like systems, this is done using the fork and exec system calls:\n\nFork: The shell creates a new process by duplicating itself using the\nfork system call.\nThis creates a child process that is an exact copy of the parent shell\nprocess (this will become important later).\nExec: The shell then replaces the child process's memory space with the\nnew command using the\nexec system call.\nThis means that the child process is now running the new command, but it\nstill has the same process ID (PID) as the original shell.\n\nAs a result, the child process can run independently of the parent shell,\nand the shell can continue to run and accept new commands. When the child\nprocess finishes executing the command, it can return an exit status to the\nparent shell, which can then display the result to the user.\n\nEven though these details are abstracted away in Rust, they are still\nimportant to understand how our shell will work. When we execute a command,\nwe will use the Command struct from the std::process module, which\ninternally handles the fork and exec system calls for us. The Command\nstruct provides a convenient way to spawn new processes and pass arguments to\nthem.\n\nBuilt-in Commands\nWith this in mind, the method of creating processes necessitates why shells\nhave built-in commands like cd (change directory) or exit. These commands\nmust be handled by the shell itself rather than being passed to the\noperating system.\nWhy? Take for example the case of cd. Remember that when we fork a new\nprocess, it is a copy of the parent shell. If we were to exec a command\nlike cd, it would change the directory of the child process, but once that\nchild process exits, the parent shell's working directory would remain\nunchanged. Thus, the shell must handle cd itself to change its own working\ndirectory. In a similar vein, the exit command must also be handled by the\nshell as it needs to terminate the shell process itself, not just a child\nprocess.\n\nImplementing cd and exit Built-in Commands\nLet's implement the cd and exit built-in commands in our shell. We'll\nadd a match arm to handle these commands before we attempt to execute any\nexternal commands. Here's how we can do that:\n\n\n  \n    \n      \n      \n        Note\n\n      \n      \n    \n    \n      The revised main function signature now returns a Result&lt;(), Box&lt;dyn Error&gt;&gt;, which allows us to handle errors more gracefully with ? instead of\npanicking.\n\n    \n  \n\nIn this new version, we do the same whitespace splitting as before to get\nthe command and its arguments. Next, in the match expression, we check\nif the command is cd or exit.\nLooking a little closer at the cd command, we use the env::set_current_dir\nfunction to change the current working directory of the shell process. If the\ndirectory change fails (for example, if the directory does not exist), we\nprint an error message to the user. The unwrap_or(&amp;\"/\") ensures that if no\nargument is provided, we default to the root directory /.\n\nYou might be asking when not use ~ as the default directory? The reason is\nthat ~ is a shell-specific shorthand for the user's home directory, and it\nis not universally recognized by all shells. Using / as the default ensures\nthat our shell behaves consistently across different environments, as / is\nthe root directory in Unix-like systems. If you want to support ~, you\nwould need to expand it to the user's home directory using dirs::home_dir()\nfrom the dirs crate. This is left as a\nfuture exercise for the reader.\n\nIn our implementation we just support the cd and exit built-in commands,\nbut for a complete, POSIX-compliant shell, there are many more built-in\ncommands that would need to be implemented, such as export, alias, and\nsource. For a complete list, see section 1.6 Built-In Utilities\nin the latest POSIX standard.\nExecuting External Commands\nNow that we have the built-in commands handled, we can implement the logic to\nexecute external commands. We'll use the Command struct from the std::process\nmodule to spawn new processes. The Command struct provides a convenient way\nto create and configure a new process, including setting the command to run,\npassing arguments, and handling input/output streams.\nTo execute an external command, we can use the Command::new method to\ncreate a new command, and then we can call the spawn method to run the command\nin a new process. For example, to run the ls -la command, we can do the\nfollowing:\n\nThis will run the ls -la command and capture its output. The output method\nreturns a Result&lt;Output&gt;, where Output contains the standard output and\nstandard error of the command. We can then print the output to the user.\nFor our shell, we'll primarily use spawn() because we want to control when to\nwait for the process to complete.\nLet's integrate this into our shell, so that it can execute external commands:\n\nNow for any external command:\n\nWe create a Command instance using Command::new(command), passing the\ncommand name as an argument.\nWe then add any additional arguments using cmd.args(&amp;args).\nCall cmd.spawn() to execute the command in a new process.\n\nThe spawn method returns a Result&lt;Child&gt;, where Child represents the spawned process. We\nthen wait for the child process to finish using child.wait(), which returns\na Result&lt;ExitStatus&gt;. If the command fails to execute, we print an error\nmessage to the user. If the command succeeds, then it will output its\nresults to the terminal via the standard output stream.\nPiping Commands\nOne of the most powerful features of Unix shells is the ability to pipe the\noutput of one command as input to another command. The pipe operator | allows\nyou to chain commands together. For example, ls | grep txt would list files\nand then filter for those containing \"txt\". A major limitation of our current\nshell is that is only supports a single command at a time, so let's\nextend our shell to support piping commands together.\nThe first thing we'll do is modify our input parsing to split the input on\nthe pipe character | instead of whitespace. This will allow us to\nhandle multiple commands in a single input line. We'll also store these\ncommands in a peekable iterator. Why peekable? Because we want to\ncheck if there are more commands to process after the current one, so we can\ndecide whether to pipe the output to the next command or not.\n\nSince we are now dealing with multiple commands, we need to keep track of\nthe output of the previous command so that we can pipe it to the next command,\nif there is one. Additionally, we want to track all of the child processes that\nwe spawn so that we can wait for them to finish later.\n\nNext, we will loop through each command in the pipeline, parsing it into\nthe command name and its arguments, and then executing it. If the command is\ncd or exit, we handle it as before. For external commands, we will set up\nthe stdin and stdout streams based on whether there is a previous command\nto pipe from or if it is the last command in the pipeline. If there is a\nprevious command, we will use its output as the input for the current command.\nPutting it all together, our updated shell now looks like this:\n\nWoohoo! Now our shell can handle multiple commands piped together!\nWhen you run the shell and enter a command like ls | wc -l, it\nwill execute each command in the pipeline, passing the output of one command\nas the input to the next command, with the final output displayed in the\nterminal.\n\n  \n  \n  \n    Example of piping commands in a shell; `ls | wc -l` counts the number\nof files in the current directory\n  \n  \n\n\nExtending Our Shell with rustyline\nIf you have been following along, you may have noticed that our shell is\nnot very user-friendly. If you make a mistake while typing a command, you\ncannot edit it by moving the cursor back with arrow keys to the mistake and\ncorrecting it. You also cannot easily recall previous commands or search\nthrough your command history.\nTo address these shortcomings and make our shell more user-friendly, we can use the\nrustyline crate to handle input and\ncommand history. This crate provides a line editor that supports features like\ncommand history, auto-completion, and more. A line editor is a text\neditor that lets users edit a single line of text, in our case, the prompt\nwhere the user types commands.\nFor us, we'll use a subset of this functionality to provide two features:\ncommand history and signal handling.\nTo get started, let's first add rustyline to our project with Cargo:\n\nCommand History\nMany shells store command history so that users can easily recall and reuse\nprevious commands. For example, in Bash, you can use the up and down arrow keys f\nor navigating through the command history, and you can use Ctrl+R to search\nfor previous commands. This is a very useful feature that makes it easier to\nreuse commands without having to retype them.\nDoing this in rustyline is very straightforward. We can use the DefaultEditor\ntype from rustyline to create a new line editor instance, and then we can\nload and save command history using the load_history and save_history\nmethods. Let's update our shell to include command history:\n\nOne thing to note is that I elect to not save empty commands to the history,\nso if the user just presses enter without typing anything, it will not be added,\nwhich is a common behavior in many shells.\nThe history file is stored in /tmp/.minishell_history, which is loaded\nwhen the shell starts and saved when the shell exits. This way, the user can\nrecall previous commands even after restarting the shell. We use the tmp/\ndirectory as it is writable by all users (and thus we don't need to deal\nwith permission issues), and it is a common place for temporary files.\nWith our shell now supporting command history, we can use the up and down\narrow keys to navigate through previous commands, and we can use Ctrl+R to\nsearch for previous commands.\n\n  \n  \n  \n    Reverse command search using `rustyline`\n  \n  \n\nSignal Handling\nHandling signals gracefully is very straightforward with rustyline. Right now,\nif the user presses Ctrl+C (SIGINT) while the shell is running, it will just\ndisplay \"minishell: Error: Interrupted\". Similarly for Ctrl+D (EOF), the\nshell just displays \"minishell: Error: Eof\".\nTo fix this, we'll adjust our match arms for matching the line input to handle\nthese signals more gracefully. Specifically, we want to exit the shell when\nthe user presses Ctrl+C or Ctrl+D, and we want to save the command history.\nSimilarly, when the user exit, we also want to save the command history before\nexiting.\n\nNow, when the user presses Ctrl+C or Ctrl-D, the shell will print a message\nand exit gracefully, saving the command history to the specified file. Outside\nof the main REPL loop, we added an Ok(()) return type to the main function\nto indicate that the shell exited successfully.\n\n  \n    \n      \n      \n        rustyline as a line editor\n\n      \n      \n    \n    \n      When I said before that rustyline was a line editor, it probably didn't\nmake much sense. What's the difference? I am still just inputting text on the\nprompt line like before?\nWell, now enter a string of commands like ls -l | grep .rs | wc -l, and then\npress Alt+B to move the cursor backwards by a word, or Ctrl+Left to move\nthe cursor left by a word. You can also use Ctrl+Right to move the cursor\nright by a word, and Ctrl+A to move the cursor to the beginning of the line,\nand Ctrl+E to move it to the end of the line. These are just a few of the\nmany features that rustyline provides as a line editor.\nNow you can easily edit your command line input, navigate through the\ncommand history, and even search for previous commands using Ctrl+R!\n\n    \n  \n\n\nBonus: Greeting Message\nBefore we finish, let's add a greeting message that displays when the shell\nstarts. I've always be a fan of the classic ASCII art logos that some shells\ndisplay (like at the start of an Apache Spark shell), so let's add a simple\nASCII art logo to our shell. We can use the println! macro to print a\nmulti-line string with the logo, and we can also print a welcome message to the\nuser:\n\nWe escape the string with r#\" to allow for multi-line \"raw\" strings without\nescaping newlines or quotes. Now our shell will display a nice ASCII art logo\nwhen it starts, along with a welcome message.\n\n  \n  \n  \n    Greeting message with ASCII art logo\n  \n  \n\nYou can explore some other cool ASCII logo graphics here if you want a different\nlogo: Text to ASCII Generator.\n\nThe Complete Script\nHere is the complete code for our simple shell, which includes command history,\nsignal handling, and a greeting message. You can copy and paste this code into\nyour src/main.rs file to run the shell:\n\n\nFinal Word\nHopefully this post has given you a good overview of how to build a simple\nshell in Rust. The complete, documented code is available on\nGitHub. If you have any\nquestions or suggestions, feel free to reach out or open an issue on the\nrepository.\nEven though our little shell is simple, it can be extended with more\nfeatures2 like syntax highlighting, command completion, custom configuration\nfiles analogous to .bashrc or .zshrc, support for environment variables,\nscripting, and more. It is left as an exercise for the reader to implement\nthese features. Feel free to fork the repository and add your own enhancements,\nand if you do, I'd love to hear how you extended it!\n\nFootnotes\n1\nThis is a simplified version of the shell lifecycle. In reality, shells\nmay have more complex lifecycles, especially when dealing with job control,\nbackground processes, and other advanced features.\nWhile technically you could classify a shell as a REPL\n(Read-Eval-Print Loop), the term REPL is more commonly used in the context\nof programming languages and interactive interpreters. A shell is more than\njust a REPL since it interacts with the operating systems and provides a\nmore general command-line interface.\nIf you are interested in the intricacies of shells, I recommend checking out\nthe codebase of an existing shell, such as Fish\n(my personal favorite), which is has been rewritten entirely in\nRust.\n\n2\nFor even more suggestions on features to add, see this assignment\ndescription\nfrom Cornell's CS414 course (Operating Systems and Systems Programming). In\naddition to another explanation and overview of shells, at the end of the\nassignment description, there is a list of features that students can\noptional implement to extend their shell. These features include things like\ntab completion, advanced I/O redirection like &gt;&amp;, and more.\n\n","id":"https://micahkepe.com/blog/minishell/","title":"Let's Build a (Mini)Shell in Rust"},"https://micahkepe.com/blog/missing-semester/":{"body":"Nearly a year ago, I took an online course called\nThe Missing Semester of Your CS Education. The\ncourse was created by a group of MIT students and covers a wide range of topics\nthat are often overlooked in traditional computer science curriculums. The\ncourse is designed to help students become more productive and efficient\nprogrammers by teaching them essential skills that are not typically taught in\nschool.\n\nStill to this day, I find myself using many of the tools and techniques that I\nlearned in the course. In this post, I will share some of the biggest takeaways\nfrom The Missing Semester of Your CS Education and how they have helped me\nbecome a better, more productive programmer.\n1. Version Control with Git\nFor such a widely used tool, it is surprising how little formal education is\ngiven on Git beyond perhaps a brief introduction to git clone, git add,\ngit commit, and git push. Personally, it wasn't until I began my first\ninternship how little I knew about Git and how much I had to learn on the job.\nThe course provides a greater overview of Git and its capabilities, including\nsome of the more advanced features that can help you become a more efficient and\neffective programmer.\nBelow are some of the less common but very useful commands that I learned from\nthe course and through my own exploration:\n1.1 Using switch instead of checkout\n\nswitch is a newer command that was introduced in Git 2.23. It is meant to be a\nmore user-friendly alternative to checkout for switching branches. The\nswitch command is more intuitive and easier to use than checkout, especially\nfor beginners. It is also more consistent with other Git commands, such as\ngit branch and git merge.\n1.2 Learning to use rebase\n\nA diagram of the rebase process:\n1. Initial State\n\nAs you can see, the feature branch has diverged from the main branch with\ncommits D and E, which are behind commit C on the main branch.\n2. After running git rebase main on the feature branch\n\nAfter rebasing, two new commits D' and E' are created on the feature\nbranch, which have new commit hashes from the original commits D and E.\nIf there are any conflicts during the rebase process, you will need to resolve\nthem before continuing.\n3. After running git switch main and git merge feature-branch\n\nFinally, the feature branch is merged back into the main branch. Now we have a\nlinear commit history!\nA key benefit of rebasing is that it keeps the commit history clean and linear,\nmaking it easier to understand and navigate.\n\nNOTE It is important to note that rebasing rewrites commit history, so\nit should be used with caution, especially when working on shared\nbranches with collaborators. If working with others, use the\n--force-with-lease flag when pushing rebased commits to a shared branch.\nThis flag ensures that if your changes conflict with the remote branch, you\nwill not overwrite someone else's work.\n\n1.3 Stashing changes\n\nThere are many other useful Git commands and techniques, but these are some of\nthe ones that I use most frequently in my day-to-day work. The best way to learn\nGit is by actually using it, struggling with it, and learning from others.\nAgain, Git can be tricky and it takes practice— Linus Torvalds, the creator of\nGit, wrote in the initial commit message of Git that it stands for:\n\n\n'global information tracker': you're in a good mood, and it actually\nworks for you. Angels sing, and a light suddenly fills the room.\n'goddamn idiotic truckload of sh*t': when it breaks\n\n\n2. Hammerspoon\nHammerspoon is an automation tool available for macOS that runs on custom Lua\nscripts. The greatest use case that I found for it was for writing scripts to\nallow me to use custom keyboard bindings to control the sizing and location of\nmy windows without having to use the mouse.\nWhile this seems like it a relatively small enhancement, the seconds saved from\nevery time I need to resize a window compound into minutes and hours saved over\ntime. Here's a snippet of the window.lua script I wrote to do this:\n\nI have not yet explored all the capabilities of Hammerspoon, but this one\nfeature alone has made it a valuable tool for me. I highly recommend checking it\nout if you are a macOS user and are looking to automate repetitive tasks or\ncreate custom keyboard shortcuts. For more information on Hammerspoon, check out\nthe official documentation.\n3. Dotfiles\nDotfiles are configuration files that are used to customize the settings of\nvarious programs and tools. They are typically stored in the home directory of a\nuser and are prefixed with a . (e.g., .bashrc, .vimrc, .gitconfig). The\ncourse introduced me to the concept of dotfiles and the benefits of storing them\nin a version-controlled repository. Additionally, setting up aliases dotfiles\ncan help you streamline your workflow and make your development environment more\nefficient.\nBy storing your dotfiles in a version-controlled repository, you can easily\nsynchronize your configurations across multiple machines and share them with\nothers. Additionally, you can keep track of changes to your configurations over\ntime and revert to previous versions if needed. If you ever switch to a new\nmachine or need to set up a new environment, you can quickly install your\ndotfiles and have your familiar configurations ready to go, especially if you\nwrite a bootstrap script to automate the process.\n3.1 Helpful aliases\nAliases are shortcuts that you can define in your dotfiles to make common\ncommands easier to type and remember. Here are some examples of aliases that you\ncan add to your .bashrc or .zshrc file to make your life easier:\n\nIn my .gitconfig file, I have also set up aliases to enhance the graph and\nlog commands:\n\n3.2 Setting up a dotfiles repository\nTo set up a dotfiles repository, you can follow these steps:\n1. Create a new directory for your dotfiles repository in your home directory:\n\n2. Initialize a new Git repository in the directory:\n\n3. Move your dotfiles into the repository and create symbolic links to them in\nyour home directory:\n\nYou can view all of your configuration files with the following command:\n\nConfiguration files that are prefixed with a . are typically hidden by\ndefault, so you may need to use the -a flag to display them.\nIf you have set up the symbolic links correctly, running the ls -a ~ command\nshould show the symbolic links in your home directory pointing to the dotfiles\nin your repository like so:\n\n  \n  \n  \n    Above: My dotfiles in my home directory symlinked to my dotfiles\n        repository.\n  \n  \n\n4. Add, commit, and push your dotfiles to your remote repository (e.g.,\nGitHub):\n\nBy following these steps, you can create a centralized repository for your\ndotfiles and easily manage your configurations across multiple machines. You can\nalso share your dotfiles with others and benefit from the productivity\nenhancements that they provide.\nThe great thing about dotfiles repositories is that doing a simple search on\nGitHub will yield many examples of how others have set up their dotfiles. You\ncan learn from their configurations and customize them to suit your own\npreferences. If you're interested in seeing an example of a dotfiles repository,\nyou can check out mine.\nConclusion\nThe Missing Semester of Your CS Education is a fantastic course that covers a\nwide range of topics that are essential for becoming a more productive and\nefficient programmer. The course has helped me improve my skills in version\ncontrol, automation, and configuration management, and I continue to use many of\nthe tools and techniques that I learned in my day-to-day work.\n","id":"https://micahkepe.com/blog/missing-semester/","title":"Biggest Takeaways from The Missing Semester of Your CS Education"},"https://micahkepe.com/blog/neovim-setup/":{"body":"Over the summer, after finally getting around to learning Vim motions (see blog\npost #9), I quickly fell down the\nNeovim rabbithole and have been procrastinating work by tinkering away at my\nconfigurations ever since! This post will be sharing setup that I have currently\nlanded at to turn my Neovim editor into a supercharged workhorse.\nTL;DR\nI think my setup is pretty sweet. If you want to try out my setup without having\nto do the configuration yourself, you can run these commands to add my setup as a\n\"profile\" that you can switch to in Neovim:\n\n\nClone the repository and install plugins:\n\n\n\nOpen Neovim with this configuration:\n\n\n\nIf you're interested in the nerdy details of my setup, keep reading!\n\n  \n    \n    Your browser doesn't support the video tag, which I use in place of .gifs, and/or the video formats in use here\n    – sorry!\n  \n  \n\n\nWhat is Neovim Anyway?\nVim (short for Vi Improved) was created by Bram Moolenaar in 1991 as an enhanced\nversion of the Vi editor, which was originally developed in 1976 by Bill Joy for\nUnix systems. Vim quickly became popular due to its efficiency and ability to\nperform complex text manipulations with minimal keystrokes.\n\n  \n  \n  \n    The original Vi program running with 'visuals'\n  \n  \n\nHowever, Vim had its limitations, especially with handling modern development\nfeatures such as better plugin systems, scripting flexibility, and ease of\nconfiguration. Neovim, a fork of Vim, was initiated in 2014\nto address these challenges and provide a more modern, extensible framework.\nNeovim differentiates itself by embracing the Lua programming language for\nfaster, more customizable configurations. This shift has given rise to a\nflourishing ecosystem of plugins that are tailored to extend Neovim’s\ncapabilities—from file navigation and autocompletion to even embedding images\ninside your text editor.\nGetting Started with Neovim\nIf you want to follow along with setup, you can install Neovim by following the\ninstructions below. If you already have Neovim installed, you can skip ahead to\nthe setup.\nTo install Neovim, check the\nINSTALL.md file on\nthe Neovim repository for the instructions for your machine.\n\n  \n  \n\nThe Setup\nFirst off, a confession. I am not using off the shelf Neovim but starting from\na very strong base configuration provided by the awesome folks at\nNVChad. NVChad is not a Neovim distro, but an opinionated\nstarting Neovim configuration that provides a great starting place.\nI particularly like NVChad for the following reasons:\n\n\nPre-configured LSP: NVChad provides a hassle-free Language Server Protocol\n(LSP) setup.\n\n\nLazy-loading Plugins: With the lazy.nvim plugin\nmanager, NVChad optimizes startup time by only loading plugins when necessary.\n\n\nRich Theming: NVChad comes with lots of themes and color schemes to choose\nfrom (I am currently using\npalenight).\n\n\nCommunity Support: NVChad’s community\nis active, and the configuration gets frequent updates and improvements.\n\n\n\n  \n  \n\nIf you are following along, let's first install NVChad before we continue:\nFor Mac and Linux Users:\n\nWindows Users:\nA little more complicated (as usual), check out the install documentation\nhere\nChanges to NVChad's Default Settings\nDiagnostics Menu\nOne of the things I changed from NVChad was the diagnostics display. By default,\nNVChad has the diagnostics displayed inline in red text. One consequence of this\nis that long diagnostic messages do not wrap at the end of the buffer, making it\ndifficult to read the entire message:\n\n  \n  \n  \n    NvChad default diagnostics\n  \n  \n\nTo make the diagnostics more readable and \"Visual-Studio-Code-like\", I changed\nthe diagnostics to underline the offending line and display to a floating window\nat the offending line on a cursor hold:\n\n  \n  \n\n\n\n  \n  \n\nTo do this, I created a separate file for the diagnostics configuration in\nnvim/lua/configs/diagnostics.lua:\n\nThen to load this configuration, I added the following lines to the top of my\nnvim/lua/configs/lspconfig.lua:\n\nEnable Hidden Files in nvim-tree Display\nAnother change I made was to show hidden files in the nvim-tree file explorer.\nBy default, hidden files are not displayed in the file explorer, which can be a\nlittle annoying when you need to access a .gitignore, configuration files, or\na .env file, for example.\nTo do this, I altered the section in the nvim/lua/init.lua file that loads\nNvChad's defined plugins:\n\nIn the nvim_tree_options.filters.custom table above, I added \"^\\\\.git$\" and\n\"DS_Store\" regular expressions to not display files from the .git/ folder,\nand to ignore the .DS_Store files that macOS creates, respectively.\n\nPlugins\nI won't be detailing every plugin that I use, but instead the ones that have\nbecome staples in my editing experience. All plugins snippets that follow will\nbe using lazy.nvim install configurations. I will break this section into the\nplugins that come by default from NVChad and the plugins that I have added on.\n\nNote: If you are curious about all of my plugins, you can see them\nhere.\n\nNVChad Plugins\nNVChad comes with a carefully curated set of plugins that provide a solid\nfoundation for your Neovim setup. Here are some of the key plugins included:\n\n\nnvim-tree/nvim-tree.lua: A\nfile explorer tree for Neovim written in Lua. It provides a sleek and\ncustomizable way to navigate your project files.\n\n\nnvim-treesitter/nvim-treesitter:\nTreesitter configurations and abstraction layer for Neovim. It provides better\nsyntax highlighting and code understanding.\n\n\nlewis6991/gitsigns.nvim:\nGit integration for buffers. It shows which lines have been added, removed, or\nmodified in the gutter.\n\n\nhrsh7th/nvim-cmp: A completion\nplugin for Neovim coded in Lua. It provides autocompletion functionality similar\nto what you'd find in modern IDEs.\n\n\nwilliamboman/mason.nvim:\nPortable package manager for Neovim that runs everywhere Neovim runs. Easily\ninstall and manage LSP servers, DAP\ndebugger servers, linters, and formatters.\n\n\nneovim/nvim-lspconfig: A\ncollection of common configurations for Neovim's built-in LSP client.\n\n\nfolke/which-key.nvim: Displays\na popup with possible key bindings of the command you started typing.\nIncredibly useful for discovering and remembering mappings.\n\n\nnvim-telescope/telescope.nvim:\nA highly extendable fuzzy finder over lists. It helps you search, filter, find,\nand pick things in your Neovim setup.\n\n\nThese plugins work together to provide a fully-featured IDE-like experience\nright out of the box. NVChad's setup ensures that these plugins are configured\nto work well together, providing a smooth and cohesive editing experience.\n\n  \n    \n    Your browser doesn't support the video tag, which I use in place of .gifs, and/or the video formats in use here\n    – sorry!\n  \n  \n\nAdded Plugins \"Musts\"\nIn no particular order, here are the plugins that I have added to augment\nNVChad's base.\ngelguy/wilder.nvim\n\n  \n    \n    Your browser doesn't support the video tag, which I use in place of .gifs, and/or the video formats in use here\n    – sorry!\n  \n  \n\nMakes navigating the Neovim command line much faster with fuzzy search\ncapabilities, providing instant suggestions as you type commands.\nWhen executing a command or searching, wilder.nvim offers a real-time list of\nsuggestions based on your command history, file paths, and available commands.\nThis dramatically speeds up workflows that involve repeated or complex command\nusage.\nlazy.nvim:\n\n3rd/image.nvim\n\n  \n    \n    Your browser doesn't support the video tag, which I use in place of .gifs, and/or the video formats in use here\n    – sorry!\n  \n  \n\nEnables image rendering in Neovim, essential for tasks like markdown previews\nand documentation editing. When editing markdown files or any other file format\nthat supports images, image.nvim renders inline images. This eliminates the need\nto switch to a browser or other external tool, making Neovim more than just a\ntext editor—it's a media-enabled workspace.\nHonestly this one was a pain in the ass to setup but worth it.\nI did have to make the switch to the Kitty\nterminal emulator from iTerm2 as they implement\ndifferent terminal image protocols (kitty vs. imgcat) and Kitty's protocol\nhas more support as of writing. Additionally, getting the right Luarocks\nversion (5.1) is a little tricky as it is an older version of Luarocks.\nHonestly, I needed images in Neovim in order to even consider making the switch\nfrom Visual Studio Code, so getting this plugin working was a non-negotiable for\nme.\n\nNote: This particular configuration of the plugin must be run in Kitty to\nwork. See the backend option if you want to use a different emulator.\n\nlazy.nvim:\n\nrmagatti/autosession\n\n  \n    \n    Your browser doesn't support the video tag, which I use in place of .gifs, and/or the video formats in use here\n    – sorry!\n  \n  \n\nAutomatically saves and restores Neovim sessions, allowing you to pick up your\nwork right where you left off. If you close Neovim and reopen it later,\nautosession will restore your previous session (open files, split windows,\netc.). This is incredibly useful when you are juggling multiple projects and\nwant to resume exactly where you left off.\nlazy.nvim:\n\nThen I define these mappings to save and restore sessions:\n\nchristoomey/vim-tmux-navigator\n\n  \n    \n    Your browser doesn't support the video tag, which I use in place of .gifs, and/or the video formats in use here\n    – sorry!\n  \n  \n\nEnables smooth navigation between Neovim windows and\ntmux panes, making it feel like a unified\nexperience. If you’re using tmux and Neovim together,vim-tmux-navigator allows\nyou to navigate between tmux panes and Neovim splits using the same keybindings\n(like &lt;C-h&gt;,&lt;C-j&gt;, &lt;C-k&gt;, and &lt;C-l&gt;). This makes my workflow more fluid\nas I don't have to think about whether I'm moving inside Neovim or across Tmux.\nNot to mention I find this bindings much less awkward than the default &lt;C-w&gt;\nVim windown motions.\nThe true value of this plugins comes when you are working in various tmux panes\nrunning a combination of Neovim, a shell, and other tools. Without thinking I\ncan navigate between these panes with ease.\nlazy.nvim:\n\n\nNote: If using NVChad, you will need to override its mapping of these keys\nto use the Tmux navigation commands instead:\n\n\nIf using tmux, add the following to your ~/.tmux.conf:\n\npocco81/auto-save.nvim\nAutomatically saves your files when you leave insert mode. This plugin is a\nlifesaver for those who forget to save their work frequently. It ensures that\nyour changes are always saved, even if you forget to do so manually. It is also\nhighly customizable, allowing you to configure the save interval and other\nsettings to suit your workflow.\nlazy.nvim:\n\nstevearc/dressing.nvim\n\n  \n  \n\nThis plugins provides way better styling to the default vim.ui interfaces. The\nbiggest improvement in my opinion is over the vim.input interface that is used\nfor renaming files in nvim-tree and renaming variable definitions using\nNvChad's renamer. This is another highly customizable plugin that allows you to\nstyle the UI to your liking.\nlazy.nvim:\n\n\nNote: this plugin has been marked as \"Read-Only\" by the owner, so I have\nsince switched to\nsnacks.input\nfor similar effect.\n\nKey Mappings\nSimilarly, I have a ton of mappings that I have defined so I will just be going\nover the ones that I can't live without. Additionally, I will not be detailing\nthe mappings that come with the NVChad base configuration (NVChad users can view\nthese by doing &lt;leader&gt;ch to pull up the mappings cheat sheet).\nQuality of Life Remaps\n\nWindow Management\nThese mappings manage window splits and layout efficiently in Neovim. The desc\nkey provides a description of the mapping for use in command help or plugins\nlike which-key.nvim.\n\nVisually Appealing Scrolling and Searching\nThese mappings keep the cursor and search result centered in the window while\nscrolling or jumping to search results.\n\nGitSigns Mappings\nThese are the mappings I use for GitSigns, which I believe are fairly standard.\ngitsigns works in \"hunks\" of code, hence all of these mappings begin with an\nh after the leader.\n\n  \n    \n    Your browser doesn't support the video tag, which I use in place of .gifs, and/or the video formats in use here\n    – sorry!\n  \n  \n\n\nOptions\nThese options provide a basic, yet highly functional configuration for Neovim\nthat enhances usability by enabling features like clipboard integration and\nbetter search behavior.\n\n\nConclusion\nWhile transitioning from VSCode to Neovim wasn’t without its challenges—\nespecially getting used to Vim motions and configuring the plugins to my\nliking—it has ultimately made my workflow faster and more enjoyable. I\nparticularly appreciated how customizable Neovim is; I can tailor it exactly to\nmy needs, unlike most GUI-based editors.\nIt took me about a month to feel completely comfortable using Neovim, but once\nthe muscle memory kicks in, you start to realize the immense productivity boost.\nIf you’re on the fence, I highly recommend giving Neovim a chance for at least a\nfew weeks.\nIf you have any questions about my setup, want to share your own tips and tricks,\nor just want to chat about Neovim, feel free to write in the comments below!\nReferences\n\nUnderstanding the Origins and the Evolution of Vi &amp; Vim\nHow I Setup Neovim On My Mac To Make it AMAZING in 2024\nNVChad Documentation\nAn Experienced (Neo)Vimmer's Workflow.\n\n","id":"https://micahkepe.com/blog/neovim-setup/","title":"Setting Up a Supercharged Neovim Configuration"},"https://micahkepe.com/blog/piantor-keyboard/":{"body":"I've ditched my traditional keyboard for a split keyboard. Here's why I made the\nswitch and how I'm finding it so far.\nWhy?\nA few months ago I stumbled upon a YouTube video1 that would start off this\nwhole chain of events.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n  \n\nThis seriously is an amazing video and I recommend giving it a watch. It's a\ngreat introduction to the world of custom keyboards and the rabbit hole that\ncomes with it.\nThe Issues with the Standard QWERTY Keyboard\nThe main issues with the standard QWERTY keyboard can be summarized with the\nfollowing:\nDiagonal Columns\nThe keys on a standard QWERTY keyboard are arranged in diagonal columns. This is\nan artifact of the typewriter days when the keys were arranged in this way to\nprevent the jamming of the mechanical keys. This is no longer an issue with\nmodern keyboards that use electrical switches, but the design stayed.\n\nAside: If you've spent time tinkering with Vim, you might have noticed\nthat the Enter key is often called &lt;CR&gt; for \"carriage return,\" which is\nanother artifact of the typewriter days.\n\nAs a consequence, keys like B are a huge stretch on modern keyboards. This\nmakes proper touch typing difficult as you'll most likely need to take your\nhands off the home row to reach these keys or resort to using non-standard\nfinger placements.\nModifier Keys Placement\nThe modifier keys (Ctrl, Option, Command/Super, Shift) are placed in\nthe corners of the board, making it nearly impossible to keep your fingers on\nthe homerow while using them. This is especially frustrating for Vim users, as\nthe Ctrl key is used in many keybindings as well as basic Vim built-in\ncommands like navigating up and down the page with Ctrl+U and Ctrl+D.\nHand Position and Ergonomics\nStandard keyboards force our wrists and hands into unnatural positions that can\nlead to repetitive strain injuries (RSI) over time. The main issues include:\n\nUlnar Deviation: Our wrists are forced to bend outward to align with the\nkeyboard\nWrist Extension: Many keyboards, especially non-mechanical ones, require\nlifting our wrists\nShoulder Tension: Hands are typically held closer together than shoulder\nwidth\nFinger Stretching: Reaching for numbers and symbols often requires awkward\nstretches\n\nA split keyboard addresses these issues by allowing each half to be positioned\nat shoulder width and angled to maintain neutral wrist position.\n\nThe Piantor\nAfter watching quite a few YouTube videos and reading a lot of blog posts, I\nsettled on the Piantor\nkeyboard2.\nThe main reasons I chose this board were:\n\n42 keys: good balance of portability and compactness, with enough\nfunctionality overlap with a standard full-sized QWERTY keyboard that wouldn't\nmake switching between the two completely alien\nwired: I wanted a wired keyboard to avoid the hassle of charging and from\nthe research I did, it seems that wired keyboards are more reliable than\nwireless\ngreat shop: Leo at BeeKeeb really is super helpful and responsive. The\nshop is only a two-man operation in Hong Kong, so it's nice to support a small\nbusiness that does great work\npre-built: I briefly considered building my own keyboard, but I decided\nthat I wanted to get a pre-built one to avoid the hassle of soldering and\nflashing firmware.\n\nWith that out of the way, I placed my order and waited for the board to arrive.\nFirst Thoughts with the Board and Dialing It In\n\n  \n  \n  \n    The Piantor keyboard. As you can see, it is a split keyboard with 42\nkeys.\n  \n  \n\nThe initial setup of any split keyboard requires patience. There's a significant\nlearning curve, but the ergonomic benefits make it worthwhile. Here's my\njourney:\nInitial Challenges\nMy preview WPM dropped to a snail's pace. The main challenges were:\n\nAdapting to the columnar layout instead of staggered keys\nLearning to use layers effectively\nTraining my thumbs to do more than just hit the spacebar\nGetting comfortable with home row mods\n\n\nConfiguring the Keyboard with QMK\nThe most common firmware for custom keyboards are QMK and\nZMK. QMK is the most popular firmware for custom\nwire keyboards, while ZMK is a newer firmware that supports wireless keyboards.\nBecause I'm using a wired keyboard, I'll be using QMK.\nLayers\nThe board comes with a default layer mapping, but I quickly realized that I\nwould need to change it to fit how I work.\nAs I do a lot of work in the terminal, especially in Neovim and Tmux sessions, I\nwanted to prioritize the ESCAPE, Enter, Ctrl, and Option as I use these\nfor tons of keymaps and navigating around.\nThe Base Layer: QWERTY + Thumb Keys\n\n  \n  \n  \n    The base layer of the split keyboard. As you can see,\nit is mostly a standard QWERTY layout except for the home row mods and the thumb\nkeys.\n  \n  \n\nThe base layer had the least amount of customization done. Ignore the TD keys\nfor now, we'll go over those more in the section on home row mods. The main\nthing to see is that with the base layer, the keyboard is essentially a 42-key\nboard that you can use to type in QWERTY, plus the thumb keys.\nThe thumb keys are one of the most powerful aspects of this layout. Our thumbs\nare naturally strong and dexterous, yet on traditional keyboards, they' re\nrelegated to just hitting the spacebar. On the Piantor, I've configured my thumb\nkeys to handle space, enter, and layer switching - tasks that traditionally\nrequired awkward pinky stretches or hand movement.\nThe First Layer: Numbers and Symbols\n\n  \n  \n  \n    The first layer of the split keyboard. This is where I am\nable to access my numbers and symbols.\n  \n  \n\nThis is where things start to get a little more spicy.\nOn my left hand, I have access to numbers, a period for writing floating point\nnumbers, and the Shift state of the normal number row.\nOn the right side, I have all the symbols remaining from the board, with the top\nrow being the rest of the Shift values of the normal number row and the rest\nof my symbols like (),  {}, and so on. This definitely took a lot of time to\nget used to, but soon muscle memory took over.\nThe Second Layer: Function Keys and Special Keys\n\n  \n  \n  \n    The second layer of the split keyboard. This is where\nI am able to access my function keys and other special keys.\n  \n  \n\nOne of my favorite aspects of this layer is the arrow key placement. They map\ndirectly to the Vim movement keys (HJKL), which means I'm using the same spatial\nmemory I've built up from Vim. This makes navigation incredibly smooth and\nintuitive - there's no cognitive overhead of learning new positions since they\nperfectly align with movements I already know.\nKarabiner-Elemments: Making the Keyboard Work with macOS\nI found that I needed to use\nKarabiner-Elements to retain some of the\nfunctionality that I had with my old keyboard. The main source of frustration\nwas from the Mac media keys not working with the Piantor keyboard. I was able to\nfix this by simply just using Karabiner-Elements without any additional\nconfiguration, which I'm sure exactly that fixed the issue, but if it ain't\nbroke, don't fix it. My guess is that by default my Macbook is interpreting the\nmedia keys as function keys, so I just had to make sure that the media keys were\nbeing used instead of the function keys.\nHome Row Mods: Making the Most Out of 42 keyboards\nReturning to those TD keys, these refer to \"tap dance\" keys, which are keys\nthat can be configured to do different things depending on how long you hold\nthem down. In my case, I've configured them to be home row modifiers.\nHome row mods are when you configure your homerow keys to act as modifiers when\nheld down. This is a great way to keep your fingers on the home row while still\nhaving access to all the modifier keys you need. I have found that I prefer this\nsetup way more than the traditional modifier key placement and that I am looking\nto carry this over to my laptop keyboard as well.\nThere are many different layouts3,4 of the modifiers that are possible,\nhowever I settled on the following, which I believe gives me a good balance of\nthe keys as a MacOS user who frequently uses all of these keys often in\ncombination:\nLeft hand modifiers:\n\nA: Ctrl when held\nS: Alt when held\nD: GUI (Command) when held\nF: Shift when held\n\nRight hand modifiers:\n\nJ: Shift when held\nK: GUI (Command) when held\nL: Alt when held\n;: Ctrl when held\n\nThis setup provides several advantages:\n\nYour fingers never leave the home row to access modifiers\nThe modifiers are symmetrically arranged, making them easier to remember\nThe strongest fingers (index and middle) control the most commonly used\nmodifiers\nEvery modifier is accessible without any stretching or hand contortion\n\nThe learning curve for home row mods is steep - it took me about two weeks to\nstop accidentally triggering modifiers while typing normally. The key is to\nadjust the tapping term (how long you need to hold a key for it to register as a\nhold rather than a tap) to find your sweet spot. In my configuration, I've set\nthis to 150ms, which provides a good balance between preventing accidental\nactivations and maintaining quick access to the modifiers.\nI also made the right middle thumb key have a tap dance as well where when I tap\nit is the Esc key and when I hold it toggles the second layer. This is\nsomething that I found really convenient when working in Vim since I use the\nEsc key so often when switching modes.\nFor a way better overview and explanation of home row mods I highly recommend\nchecking out this blog post by\nprecondition.5\n\n  \n    \n      \n      \n        Setting Up Home Row Mods on Built-in MacBook Keyboard\n\n      \n      \n    \n    \n      For configuring home row mods on the built-in Mac laptop keyboard, you can\nuse Karabiner-Elements or KMonad.\nPersonally, I used Karabiner-Elements, which lets you set up home row mods using\na JSON configuration file. I used the JSON from this blog\npost to setup my home row mods on\nmy Mac laptop keyboard.\n\n    \n  \n\nLearning Tools: Retraining Muscle Memory\nSwitching to a split keyboard meant essentially relearning how to type. Here are\nthe tools that helped me make the transition:\n\n\nKeybr: This was invaluable for relearning proper\ntouch typing. The adaptive algorithm helped me focus on problematic keys and\ngradually build up speed without developing bad habits.\n\n\nMonkeyType: Once I had the basics down,\nMonkeyType helped me work on speed and accuracy. Its clean interface and\nvariety of text options kept practice sessions engaging.\n\n\nKeyCastr: This visual key display\ntool was crucial for debugging my typing. Being able to see my keystrokes in\nreal-time helped me catch mistakes and verify I was using the correct keys,\nespecially when working with different layers.\n\n\n\nTip: If you're making the switch, I recommend starting with Keybr to build\nproper fundamentals, then graduating to MonkeyType for speed training. Keep\nKeyCastr running initially to catch any layer or modifier key mistakes.\n\n\nConclusion: Is it Worth It?\nIt depends. If you're looking for a new hobby and are willing to spend a lot\nof time and the money on a keyboard, then I think it could potentially be a good\nchoice.\nPersonally, I love the uniqueness of the board, the customization options, and\noverall the smoothness and tactility of the experience. Just from the short time\nthat I have been using this board I've noticed:\n\nMy touch typing has significantly improved\nAbsolutely no wrist pain, which I would sometimes get from prolonged coding\nsessions in the past.\nMuch more enjoyable typing experience overall (some \"shiny object syndrome\" is\ndefinitely at play too here)\nRarely having to use my mouse anymore as I just began using keyboard shortcuts\nfor everything. This includes navigating around the Brave browser, which comes\nwith native keyboard navigation shortcuts like Space to page down, since\nall of my modifier keys are now so easily accessible from either my home row\nor thumbs. I have also added more shortcuts to my Hammerspoon configuration\nfor all sorts of quick app toggling.\n\nHonestly, if you've already drank the Kool-Aid with Vim... this is just the next\nstep on your journey to becoming an even bigger nerd.\n\nFootnotes\n1\nChristian Selig's Custom Keyboard Build:\nDetailed process of building a custom keyboard from scratch.

How are they created,\ndistributed, and installed? In this post, we'll explore the lifecycle of\nsoftware packages, from creation to installation, using the Node Package\nManager (NPM) and the Autoprefixer package as real-world examples.\nIntroduction\nWhat Are Software Packages?\nChances are, you've used a software package. Software packages are\ncollections of code, resources, and metadata that provide specific\nfunctionality. They can be libraries, tools, or applications that help\ndevelopers build software more efficiently.\nFor example, this website uses various software packages like React, Vite,\nand Tailwind CSS to create a modern, responsive, and interactive user\nexperience. These packages provide pre-built functionality that developers\ncan leverage in their projects. Software packages are essential for modern\nsoftware development, enabling code reuse, dependency management, and\nefficient development workflows.\nHow Do Software Packages Work?\nCreation and Distribution\nCreating a software package involves writing code (shocker) that provides\na specific functionality and then packaging it with metadata, documentation,\nand licensing information. The packaged code can then be published to a\nrepository like NPM (Node Package Manager), making it available for others to\nuse. Here's a simplified overview:\n\nWrite the Code: Develop the core functionality of your package.\nPackage the Code: Include metadata, documentation, and licensing information.\nPublish: Upload the package to a repository like NPM.\n\nInstallation and Dependency Management\nWhen you install a software package using a package manager like NPM, the\npackage manager handles the downloading and installation of the package along\nwith its dependencies. Dependencies are other packages that your package\nrelies on to function correctly.\n\n  \n    \n      \n      \n        Package Manager Tasks\n\n      \n      \n    \n    \n      \nDownload: The package and its dependencies are fetched from the repository.\nInstall: The package and its dependencies are installed in your project.\nConfigure: The package manager ensures that all dependencies are compatible.\n\n\n    \n  \n\nDependency Resolution\nDependency resolution is the process of determining which versions of\ndependencies to install to ensure compatibility and prevent conflicts. NPM\nuses the package-lock.json file to lock the versions of installed packages,\nensuring that the same versions are used if the project is shared with others.\nA Brief Overview of Package Managers and NPM\nPackage managers like NPM are crucial tools in modern development workflows.\nThey handle the distribution, installation, and management of software\npackages, making it easier for developers to build and maintain their projects.\npackage.json\nThe package.json file is the heart of any Node.js project. It contains\nvarious metadata relevant to the project, such as the project’s name,\nversion, description, main entry point, scripts, dependencies, and more.\npackage-lock.json\nThe package-lock.json file is automatically generated when you run npm  install. It locks the versions of installed packages, ensuring that the same\nversions are used if the project is shared with others.\nReal-World Example: Autoprefixer\nNow, let's look at the Autoprefixer package, which is one of packages used\nfor this website and is used to parse CSS and add vendor prefixes to CSS\nrules to ensure cross-browser compatibility.\nDirectory Structure\nHere's the directory structure of the Autoprefixer package in node_modules:\n\nFiles and Their Purposes\nFile/DirectoryPurpose\nLICENSE &amp; README.mdThese files provide licensing information and documentation for the package.\nbin/autoprefixerThis script file is used for executing the Autoprefixer tool from the command line.\ndata/prefixes.jsContains data about the CSS prefixes.\nlib/This directory contains the core code for the Autoprefixer package, organized into various modules.\n\npackage.json\nHere's the package.json file for Autoprefixer:\n\nLet's break down some key fields in the package.json file:\n\nname: The name of the package.\nversion: The current version of the package.\ndescription: A brief description of what the package does.\nengines: Specifies the versions of Node.js that are compatible with\nthis package.\nkeywords: Keywords that help identify the package in searches.\nmain: The entry point for the package.\nbin: The executable file for the package.\ntypes: The TypeScript declaration file for the package.\nfunding: Information about how the package is funded.\nauthor: The author of the package.\nlicense: The license under which the package is released.\nrepository: The repository where the source code is hosted.\nbugs: The URL where issues can be reported.\npeerDependencies: Other packages that are required for this package to work correctly.\ndependencies: The packages that this package depends on.\n\nCreating a Software Package (Example: date-formatter)\nTo illustrate the creation of a software package, let's build a hypothetical\nexample package called date-formatter. This package will provide functions\nto format dates in various ways. We'll use Node.js and NPM for this example.\nStep 1: Setting Up Your Project\n\n\nInitialize the project:\n\n\n\nAdd some functionality:\nCreate an index.js file with a simple date formatting function.\n\n\n\n\n\nStep 2: Preparing for Distribution\nBefore distributing the package, you should ensure it has proper\ndocumentation, licensing, and metadata.\n\n\nAdd a README file:\n\n\n\nAdd a LICENSE file:\nChoose a license for your package and add a LICENSE file. For example,\nan MIT license. The license is important for clarifying how others can use\nyour package.\n\n\nUpdate the package.json file:\nAdd an entry point to the index.js file and specify the main\nfunctionality of the package.\n\n\n\nStep 3: Publishing the Package\nNow that your package is ready, you can publish it to the NPM registry for\nothers to use.\n\n  Create an NPM account:\nIf you don't already have one, create an account on NPM.\n  \n  Login to NPM:\n\n  \n  Publish the package:\n\nThis command will upload the package to the NPM registry. This registry is a\nlarge database that stores all the packages and their versions. When someone\nruns npm install &lt;package-name&gt;, NPM searches the registry for the package,\ndownloads it, and installs it along with its dependencies.\nThe NPM registry ensures that packages are easily discoverable and accessible\nto developers around the world. It also handles versioning, so developers can\nspecify which versions of a package they need, and NPM will resolve dependencies\naccordingly.\nCongratulations! Your package is now available for others to\ninstall and use.\n  \n\n\nConclusion\nUnderstanding how software packages work, from creation to distribution to\ninstallation, is fundamental for modern software development. By examining a\nreal-world example like Autoprefixer and creating a hypothetical package, we've\nseen the key components and processes involved in package managemenjson.\nI hope that this article demystified the world of software packages and\ninspired you to explore the vast ecosystem of packages available to\ndevelopers. Whether you're building a simple utility or a complex\napplication, software packages can help you save time, reduce errors, and\nfocus on what matters most: building great software.\nReferences\n\nNPM Documentation\nWhat is Software Package?\nPackage Manager (Wikipedia)\nCreating and publishing scoped public packages\n\n","id":"https://micahkepe.com/blog/software-packages/","title":"How Do Software Packages Work?"},"https://micahkepe.com/blog/sqlite-query-optimizer/":{"body":"I love databases, but they are still largely a magical black box to me, so\nin this post, I'm going to explore how SQLite's query optimizer works. We'll\ndelve together into the process of how SQL queries are parsed, optimized, and\nexecuted, with a particular focus on the optimization phase. By the end of this\npost, you'll have a better understanding of how SQLite's query optimizer works\nand how it can help you write more efficient queries.\n\nThis past summer, I got a lot of practice learning the ins and outs of SQLite as\npart of a project that I have been contributing to, which we originally set up\nwith a SQLite database. I've been working with SQLite for a while now, and I've\ncome to appreciate its simplicity and ease of use.\nWhat Actually Happens When You Run a Query?\nRegardless of the database engine you're using, when you run a query, the\ndatabase engine goes through a series of steps to execute the query. These steps\ninclude:\n\nWriting: The query is written and sent to the database engine.\nParsing: The query is parsed to ensure it is syntactically correct.\nPlanning: The query planner generates an execution plan for the query.\nExecution: The query is actually executed and the results are returned.\n\nOf course, while these steps are common to all database engines, the way they\nare implemented can vary significantly from one engine to another.\n\n  \n  \n  \n    Overview of the query execution process\n  \n  \n\nSQLite's Approach to Query Optimization\nBecause SQLite is open source and has a small codebase, it’s relatively easy to\nunderstand how it works. The query optimizer in SQLite might seem like a modest\nengine at first glance, but under the hood, it's a sophisticated piece of\nsoftware that makes smart decisions to ensure your queries run efficiently.\nSQLite's query optimizer uses several different strategies to optimize query\nperformance:\n\n\nIndex Selection: SQLite intelligently selects the best indexes to speed up\ndata retrieval. It considers various factors, such as the columns in the WHERE\nclause and the order in which they appear.\n\n\nJoin Ordering: For queries that involve joins, SQLite tries to figure out\nthe most efficient order to join the tables. It uses heuristics and statistics\nto make an educated guess that minimizes the computational cost.\n\n\nSubquery Flattening: SQLite tries to flatten subqueries, meaning it\nattempts to merge subqueries into the main query whenever possible. This\nreduces the overhead of executing multiple queries separately.\n\n\nCovering Indexes: If an index contains all the columns needed by the\nquery, SQLite can retrieve the results directly from the index without\naccessing the actual table, significantly speeding up the query.\n\n\nCost Estimation: SQLite uses a cost-based query planner, which estimates\nthe cost of different execution plans and chooses the one with the lowest\nestimated cost. The cost is generally a measure of how much disk I/O and CPU\ntime will be consumed.\n\n\nThese strategies help SQLite balance efficiency and performance, making it an\nexcellent choice for applications where lightweight and quick database\noperations are essential.\nSimple Example Query\nNow that we have a basic understanding of how SQLite's query optimizer works,\nlet's take a look at a simple example query and see how it's optimized.\nBorrowing from the Rice University legend, Dr. Christopher Jermaine, let's say\nwe have the following relational schema:\n\nFor demonstration, I'll be using the\nSQLite Online Compiler to run the queries. Suppose\nwe want to find all the beers that Ava likes with the following query:\n\n\n  \n  \n  \n    Results of the simple query\n  \n  \n\nAs we can see, we get the expected results for this query. But how does SQLite's\nquery optimizer actually execute this query?\nAnalyzing the Query: Breaking Down SQLite's Execution Process\n1. Parsing the Query\nThe first thing SQLite does is parse the SQL statement. The parser checks the\nquery for any syntax errors and builds a parse tree—a hierarchical\nrepresentation of the query. This step ensures that the SQL statement is valid\nand prepares it for further processing.\n2. Generating the Execution Plan\nAfter parsing, SQLite moves on to the query planning phase, where it generates\nan execution plan. An execution plan is a step-by-step roadmap of how SQLite\nwill retrieve the data. This involves several key decisions:\n\n\nTable Access Method: SQLite needs to decide how to access the LIKES\ntable. Since the WHERE clause filters rows based on the DRINKER column,\nSQLite considers whether there's an index on DRINKER that can speed up the\nretrieval.\n\n\nIndex Usage: If there were an index on the DRINKER column, SQLite might\nuse it to directly look up rows where DRINKER = 'Ava'. However, in this\ncase, there’s no such index, so SQLite will perform a full table scan.\n\n\nWe can inspect the execution plan using the EXPLAIN QUERY PLAN command:\n\nAs expected since there's no index on the DRINKER column, the output is:\n\n3. Full Table Scan Explained\nThe plan indicates \"SCAN LIKES,\" meaning SQLite will read through the entire\nLIKES table, row by row, to find matches where DRINKER = 'Ava'. Here’s how\nit works:\n\nSQLite starts at the first row of the LIKES table and checks if the\nDRINKER column equals 'Ava'.\nIf it matches, SQLite includes the BEER column from that row in the result\nset.\nThis process repeats for every row in the table.\n\nEven though a full table scan is the least efficient method (especially with\nlarge tables), it’s the only option when no suitable index is available. For\nsmall tables like our example, the performance impact is minimal, but with\nlarger datasets, this could become a bottleneck.\n4. Using Rowid Lookups for Efficiency\nWhile full table scans are sometimes necessary, SQLite often relies on rowid\nlookups to speed up queries when no more specific index is available. Each\ntable in SQLite has a unique identifier for each row called the rowid. If your\nquery involves this rowid directly, SQLite can perform a binary search on this\nidentifier, which is significantly faster than a full table scan.\nFor example, consider the following query:\n\nIn this case, SQLite will directly use the rowid to locate the record, bypassing\nthe need to scan every row in the table. This technique can be particularly\nuseful when you know the specific rowid of the data you need to retrieve.\n5. Execution: Returning the Results\nOnce the execution plan is ready, SQLite moves to the execution phase. The\ndatabase engine follows the plan, scanning the LIKES table, filtering rows,\nand collecting the BEER values where DRINKER is 'Ava'. The results are then\nreturned to the user.\nIn this simple case, the query returns:\n\nThese results match what we expected because the query is straightforward and\nthe table is small.\n6. Optimizing the Query (The What-If Scenario)\nLet’s imagine we want to optimize this query. The most effective way would be\nto create an index on the DRINKER column. With an index, SQLite could:\n\nSkip the Full Table Scan: Instead of scanning the entire table, SQLite\ncould directly jump to the rows where DRINKER = 'Ava', significantly\nspeeding up the query.\n\nHere’s how you could create the index:\n\nWith this index, if you run the same query again:\n\nSQLite would use the index to find all rows with DRINKER = 'Ava' directly,\nreducing the amount of work it needs to do.\nNow when we EXPLAIN QUERY PLAN command to inspect how SQLite would handle the\nquery now, we see:\n\n    SEARCH LIKES USING INDEX idx_drinker (DRINKER=?) \n\nThis indicates that SQLite is now using the idx_drinker index to perform a\nmuch faster search. Instead of scanning the entire table, it quickly narrows\ndown the relevant rows using the index, demonstrating a significant improvement\nin query performance.\nTakeaways from the Simple Query Example\nThis simple example highlights how SQLite’s query optimizer works in the\nbackground to execute SQL queries efficiently. While a full table scan might be\nacceptable in small tables, as your data grows, understanding and utilizing\nindexes can make a world of difference in performance.\nEven in this simple query, we've uncovered the critical role the query planner\nplays in determining how to retrieve your data efficiently, and how small\nchanges—like adding an index—can lead to significant performance gains.\nIn the next sections, we’ll dive deeper into more complex queries and see how\nSQLite handles more challenging scenarios, giving you the tools to write even\nmore efficient SQL code.\n\nComplex Query Example: Getting to the Heart of the Optimizer\nNow that we’ve covered the basics, let’s look at a more complicated query that\ngives SQLite’s optimizer something to chew on.\nImagine we have two tables, DRINKER and BEER, and we want to perform a query\nthat joins them to find out which beers each drinker likes, sorted by their\npreference. The schema might look something like this:\n\nAnd let's populate the tables with some example data:\n\nNow, suppose we want to find out which beers each drinker likes, sorted by their\npreference:\n\nThis query isn’t as simple as it looks. SQLite’s optimizer has to decide:\n\nJoin Order: Should it start with the DRINKER, LIKES, or BEER table?\nIndex Usage: Which indexes, if any, can be used to speed up the joins\nand the sorting?\nSorting: How should the results be sorted efficiently after the joins?\n\nUnderstanding the Query Plan: What Happens Behind the Scenes\nWhen we look at the query plan for the complex query:\n\nWe get the following output:\n\nThis output provides a high-level overview of how SQLite intends to execute the\nquery. Let’s break down each component and understand what’s happening under the\nhood.\n1. Scan the LIKES Table\n\nPlan Step: SCAN LIKES\n\nSQLite begins by scanning the LIKES table. Since LIKES is the central table\nin this query, containing the foreign keys that link DRINKER to BEER, it\nmakes sense for SQLite to start here.\n\nWhy a Table Scan?: The plan shows that SQLite performs a full table scan\non LIKES, meaning it reads every row in the table. This might seem\ninefficient, but without specific indexes on DRINKER_ID or BEER_ID, a\nfull scan is necessary to gather all the relevant data.\n\n2. Searching the DRINKER and BEER Tables\n\nPlan Steps:\n\nSEARCH DRINKER USING INTEGER PRIMARY KEY (rowid=?)\nSEARCH BEER USING INTEGER PRIMARY KEY (rowid=?)\n\n\n\nFor each row in LIKES, SQLite needs to find the corresponding DRINKER and\nBEER entries. It uses the primary key indexes (INTEGER PRIMARY KEY) on\nthese tables to quickly locate the matching rows.\n\nPrimary Key Lookup: Because both DRINKER.ID and BEER.ID are defined\nas primary keys, SQLite can perform an efficient lookup using these\nindexes. The query plan indicates that for each LIKES entry, SQLite\nperforms a quick search in both DRINKER and BEER tables to retrieve the\nNAME fields.\n\n3. Using a Temporary B-Tree for Sorting\n\nPlan Step: USE TEMP B-TREE FOR ORDER BY\n\nThe final step in the query plan involves sorting the results. The query\nrequests that the results be ordered by DRINKER.NAME and LIKES.PREFERENCE.\nSince the data isn’t naturally ordered in this way, SQLite must perform\nadditional work to achieve this sort order.\n\n\nTemporary B-Tree: To sort the results efficiently, SQLite creates a\ntemporary B-tree structure. A B-tree is a self-balancing tree data structure\nthat maintains sorted data and allows for efficient insertion, deletion, and\nlookup operations. By inserting the result set into this B- tree, SQLite can\nquickly and efficiently retrieve the data in the desired order.\n\n\nWhy Not an Index?: The need for a temporary B-tree indicates that there\nisn’t an existing index that supports the required sort order. This extra step\nadds overhead, which is why creating an appropriate index can be beneficial.\n\n\nCombining all these steps, we get the expected output:\n\n  \n  \n  \n    Results of the complex query\n  \n  \n\n\nOptimizing the Query: Adding a Multi-Column Index\nAs mentioned earlier, one way to improve this query's performance is by adding\nan index on the LIKES table. Specifically, creating a multi-column\nindex on the combination of DRINKER_ID and PREFERENCE would directly\nsupport the sorting required by the query:\n\nBy creating this multi-column index, SQLite can:\n\n\nAvoid Full Table Scans: With this index, SQLite can avoid a full scan of\nthe LIKES table. Instead, it can directly jump to the relevant rows using\nthe index, which is more efficient.\n\n\nOptimize Sorting: The index also covers the PREFERENCE column, which\nmeans the results can be retrieved in the correct order directly from the\nindex. This eliminates the need for a temporary B-tree, reducing the query’s\noverall execution time.\n\n\n\n  \n  \n  \n    Example multicolumn index from the SQLite query planner\n        documentation illustrating a lookup using the index.\n  \n  \n\nRe-running the Query Plan\nAfter creating the index, if we re-run the EXPLAIN QUERY PLAN command, we\nmight see a different plan:\n\nThe updated plan now reflects the use of the new index:\n\nThis new execution plan reflects several optimizations made by SQLite:\n\n\nSCAN DRINKER:\nSQLite starts by scanning the DRINKER table. Since this is a full table\nscan, it reads each row from the DRINKER table sequentially. This step\nmakes sense as it’s the starting point of our query, and no filters or\nconstraints are applied to DRINKER that would allow an index to be used\nhere.\n\n\nSEARCH LIKES USING INDEX idx_likes_drinker_pref (DRINKER_ID=?):\nHere’s where the optimization kicks in. SQLite uses the newly created index\nidx_likes_drinker_pref on the LIKES table. This index is likely created\non the DRINKER_ID and PREFERENCE columns, allowing SQLite to efficiently\nfind the rows in LIKES where DRINKER_ID matches the current row from the\nDRINKER table. This dramatically reduces the amount of data SQLite needs to\nsift through compared to a full table scan.\n\n\nSEARCH BEER USING INTEGER PRIMARY KEY (rowid=?):\nFor the BEER table, SQLite utilizes the primary key index, which is an\nautomatically created index on the ID column (which acts as the rowid).\nSince this is the most efficient way to retrieve specific rows from BEER,\nSQLite uses this index to quickly find the beer names corresponding to the\nBEER_ID values from the LIKES table.\n\n\nUSE TEMP B-TREE FOR ORDER BY:\nFinally, SQLite notes that it will use a temporary B-Tree to sort the results\naccording to the ORDER BY clause (DRINKER.NAME and LIKES.PREFERENCE).\nEven though indexes can often help with sorting, in this case, SQLite decides\nto use a temporary B-Tree structure to ensure that the results are returned\nin the correct order. This step can be a bit more resource-intensive, but it\nguarantees that the results will be sorted as requested.\n\n\nThe use of the idx_likes_drinker_pref index significantly improves the\nefficiency of the query. By avoiding a full table scan on LIKES, SQLite\nreduces the amount of data it needs to process, which speeds up query execution,\nespecially on larger datasets.\nThe final ORDER BY clause requires SQLite to sort the results, and since\nthe current indexes do not cover both DRINKER.NAME and LIKES.PREFERENCE,\nSQLite opts to use a temporary B-Tree. If you frequently run this query and\nnotice the sorting step is a bottleneck, you could consider creating a\ncomposite index on these two columns to further optimize performance.\n\nConclusion: Tips for Writing Efficient Queries\nBy peeking under the hood at how SQL queries are executed, you can gain some\nintuition on why certain queries are faster than others. Here are a few tips\nto keep in mind:\n\n\nIndex Your Foreign Keys: Always create indexes on columns used in JOIN\nconditions. This speeds up the process of matching rows between tables.\n\n\nUse Covering Indexes: If possible, create indexes that cover all the\ncolumns your query needs, so SQLite doesn’t need to access the main table at\nall.\n\n\nWrite Selective WHERE Clauses: If your WHERE clause can quickly\neliminate rows from consideration, your query will run faster. The fewer rows\nSQLite has to process, the better.\n\n\nAvoid Redundant Sorting: If you know your data is already sorted in the\nway you want, avoid using ORDER BY. It just adds unnecessary processing\ntime.\n\n\nOptimize Subqueries: Subqueries can sometimes be rewritten as joins,\nwhich might be more efficient, especially if the subquery’s result set is\nlarge.\n\n\nUnderstand the Query Planner: Use tools like EXPLAIN QUERY PLAN to\nunderstand how SQLite executes your queries. Sometimes, a small change in the\nquery structure can lead to a big performance improvement.\n\n\nLearning to write efficient SQL queries is a valuable skill that translates\nacross all database systems and can make a significant difference in your\napplication’s performance, scalability, and resource usage. Like most things, it\ntakes practice and experimentation and this post just scratches the surface of\noptimizing queries.

What he ended up submitting was\na paper about \"the cutest program [he] ever wrote\"-- a sneaky undetectable\nself-reproducing \"Trojan horse\" backdoor in the C compiler that would allow him\nto log into affected machines as any user.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n  \n\n\n\n  \n  \n\n\n\n  \n  \n\nOverview\nThompson didn't want to write about the usual things that Turing award winners\nwrite about— in fact, according to him,1 he didn't want to write a paper at\nall. However, when he did finally write a paper (after putting it off for a year\npast the original deadline, see ~2:52:49 in the above video), he describes at a\nhigh level how the C compiler (itself a program written in C) parses and\ncompiles C source code into machine code to set the stage for how the \"Trojan\nhorse\" would be injected into the generated machine code while leaving the\noriginal input C source code seemingly unmodified.\nHe explains that while in college at UC Berkeley, him and colleagues would\n\"[amuse themselves] by posing programming exercises,\" one of which was \"to\nwrite the shortest self-reproducing program\":\n\nMore precisely stated, the problem is to write a source program that, when\ncompiled and executed, will produce as output an exact copy of its source ...\nThe part about \"shortest\" was just an incentive to demonstrate skill and\ndetermine a winner.\n\nThe Trojan Horse\nIn this section, I'll try to illustrate the \"Trojan horse\" originally presented\nby Thompson through a combination of the original quasi-C pseudocode and the\nsource code and examples from Russ Cox's article on this subject, where Cox got\nThompson to actually send him the source code after seeing a talk Thompson gave\nin 2023.2\nStage I: Self-Reproducing Programs\nIn this stage, Thompson describes a self-reproducing program (also known as a\n\"quine\"3). The key insight is that a program can contain its own source code\nas data, which it then prints along with the code to print it.\nHere's Thompson's example from the paper:\n\nThere are two critical properties here to make note of for later:\n\n\"This program can easily be written by another program.\"\n\"This program can contain an arbitrary amount of excess baggage that will be\nreproduced along with the main algorithm.\"\n\n\n  \n    \n      \n      \n        'Simple Transliterations' Note from Original Paper\n\n      \n      \n    \n    \n      Here are some simple transliterations to allow a non-C programmer to read this\ncode:\nOperatorMeaning\n=assignment\n==equal to\n!=not equal to\n++increment\n`x`single character constant\n\"xxx\"multiple character string\n%dformat to convert to decimal\n%sformat to convert to string\n\\ttab character\n\\nnewline character\n\n\n    \n  \n\nHere's a classic Python quine to demonstrate the self-reproducing behavior:\n\ns holds a string that is almost the whole program, including the placeholder\n%r, which formats via repr(). The print(s % s) uses Python's old C-style\n%-formatting.\nImportant notes about the characters inside s:\n\n%r is a placeholder: it tells Python to insert the repr() of the argument\ndoing the %-formatting.\n\\n is the newline character to separate the two source lines produced in the\noutput.\n%% is to be able to include a literal % in a string that will be used with\n%-formatting; after formatting it becomes a single %.\n\nThe %r inside the string is replaced by the Python string representation of\ns itself, so the program prints the text of s = ... followed by the print\nline. The %r is the key as it auto-escapes and auto-quotes the representation\nso the printed string is a valid piece of Python code. Here's the result of\nrunning the program:\n\nStage II: Compilers \"Learn\"\nThompson uses the example of how the C compiler handles character escape\nsequences to show how a compiler can teach itself new knowledge.\nIn C, you can write string literals with escape sequences:\n\nThe compiler needs to know what character code \\n represents. Here's the\nclever part: the compiler can learn this in a completely portable way.\n\nThis code handles the backslash escape sequences. Notice how it uses '\\n' to\nreturn the newline character—the compiler \"knows\" what \\n means because it's\nbaked-in to C itself.\nOk, now suppose we want to add support for \\v (vertical tab). We'd like to write:\n\nBut there's a problem: the current compiler doesn't understand \\v yet, so this\nsource code won't compile— we need to \"train\" the compiler first.\nThe solution is to temporarily use the actual character code (11 for vertical\ntab in ASCII):\n\nThis version compiles successfully with the old compiler. Once we compile and\ninstall this new binary as the official C compiler, it now \"knows\" what \\v\nmeans. We can then go back and rewrite the code using the portable '\\v' form\n(Figure 2.2), and the new compiler will accept it.\nAs Thompson notes:\n\nThis is a deep concept. It is as close to a \"learning\" program as I have seen.\nYou simply tell it once, then you can use this self-referencing definition.\n\nThis self-referencing property is key to understanding how the Trojan horse\nworks: once the compiler is \"taught\" something malicious, it can perpetuate that\nknowledge even after the evidence is removed from the source code.\nStage III: Slipping in the Trojan Horse\nSo now we have arrived to the actual Trojan horse logic. The idea of a Trojan\nhorse predates Thompson's original work on C by at least a few years, with\nThompson saying in the paper that he originally read about such an attack in \"an\nAir Force critique of the security of an early implementation of\nMultics.\"4,5\nThompson's paper presents the concept in pseudocode:\n\nBut here's the actual implementation from Thompson's nih.a file, with\nannotations by Russ Cox (I highly recommend seeing his article for a more\ndetailed step-through of the code, as well as following along with his Unix\nsimulator):2\n\nThis code does three things:\n\nBackdoors the login program: When compiling login.c, it inserts code\nthat accepts the password \"codenih\" for any user\nRecognizes itself: When compiling the C compiler (cc.c), it detects\nspecific patterns that identify the compiler source\nSelf-reproduces: When compiling the compiler, it injects the code for\nboth backdoors into the new compiler binary\n\nThe final piece is the self-reproduction mechanism:\n\n\n  \n    \n      \n      \n        Why Source Code Auditing Fails Here\n\n      \n      \n    \n    \n      No amount of reviewing source code would catch this, because the malicious logic\nnever appears in the source once the system is \"trained.\" The infection exists\none layer below—inside the binary that generates other binaries. This is the\nessence of the Trusting Trust problem: if your compiler (or any build tool) is\ncompromised, every program it builds is potentially compromised—even if their\nsources are pristine.\n\n    \n  \n\nThe Training Process\nTo actually deploy this attack, Thompson had to \"train\" the compiler in stages:\n\n\nFirst compilation: Take a clean C compiler and add the codenih() and\nrepronih() functions to its source. The %0 placeholder gets expanded by a\nhelper script (rc) into the actual byte values of the source code itself.\n\n\nInstall backdoored compiler: Compile this modified source with the clean\ncompiler, creating a backdoored binary. Install this as the official C\ncompiler.\n\n\nRemove evidence: Now recompile the C compiler using the backdoored\nbinary, but this time using the original clean source code (without the\nbackdoor code). The backdoored compiler will recognize the compiler source\nand inject the backdoor code anyway, creating a new backdoored binary.\n\n\nPerpetuation: From this point forward, the backdoor lives only in the\nbinary. Every time the compiler compiles itself, it injects the backdoor.\nEvery time it compiles login.c, it inserts the password backdoor. The\nsource code remains clean.\n\n\nClosing\nWas this actually ever distributed in the C compiler?\nIn an email from Thompson to an inquirer6, Thompson writes:\n\nSo, at least according to Thompson, this never made it out into the wild.\nHowever he also does leave this humorous line in the ACM paper:\n\nThe moral is obvious. You can't trust code that you did not totally create\nyourself. (Especially code from companies that employ people like me.)\n\nFor those interested, there has been followup research conducted after\nThompson's paper that have shown how to prevent these types of attacks, like\ndiverse double-compiling (DDC).7,8\n\nReferences\n1\nYouTube: Oral History of Ken\nThompson by Computer\nHistory Museum.\nOriginal inspiration for this post, a great history from the man himself\ndescribing his life and career from building Ham radios in his youth to his\ntime at Bell Labs to his time at Google.\n\n2\nBlog: Running the “Reflections on Trusting Trust”\nCompiler.

But what if you need to switch\nto another project? Do you close all of your tabs now, or open an entirely new\nterminal window? What if you have many projects you are switching between? This\nquickly grows unwieldy and disorganized.\n\n  \n  \n  \n    Yikes\n  \n  \n\nInstead, with a multiplexer, you can simply create a new session in tmux that\ncan have an arbitrary amount of windows (\"tabs\"), which themselves can have\nmultiple panes (\"splits\"/ views, such as vertical splits).\n\n  \n  \n  \n    Interactive window switching in tmux\n  \n  \n\nBenefits\nSome of my favorite aspects of a terminal multiplexer workflow are:\n\n\nPersistent sessions → Don't lose your setup or running processes.\nFrom the tmux man page1:\n\nSo, even if I close my computer or exit my terminal emulator application, all\nI have to do is reattach to tmux and resume my work, exactly how I left it\nbefore.\n\n  \n    \n    Your browser doesn't support the video tag, which I use in place of .gifs, and/or the video formats in use here\n    – sorry!\n  \n  \n  \n    Example of resuming work with `tmux`\n  \n  \n\nThe benefit of this is most obvious in my opinion when working on remote\nmachines. With a tmux server running on a remote server, I can SSH into the\nserver, run tmux attach to reattach to my sessions, and then simply detach\nwhen I am done and log off the machine. If there's some long running\nprocessing like a logger, I can just keep it running in a tmux window and\ndetach and it will continue running even when I exit from the remote machine.\n\n\nOrganized → keep all your different projects organized with their\nown state and labeled with their respective directories or custom names.\n\n\n\n  \n    \n      \n      \n        Note: tmux Alternative: GNU Screen\n\n      \n      \n    \n    \n      Another terminal multiplexer you might have heard about is GNU\nScreen (screen). I\nhave used screen in the past but personally I prefer tmux, however, the core\nof both programs is essentially the same multiplexing workflow.\n\n    \n  \n\nFurther Learning\nGoing over getting started using tmux is outside of the scope of this blog\npost, but I recommend the following resources to help you get started if you are\ninterested:\n\nYouTube MIT Missing Semester - Lecture 5: Command-line Environment\n(2020)\nWebsite Linux Handbook - Getting Started with Tmux\nReference Tmux Cheatsheet\nMan Page tmux(1)\n\nWith that said, the rest of this post will assume at least a minimum working\nproficiency with tmux and its terminology (sessions, panes, windows, etc.).\n\nPreview of Changes\nIn this post we'll take your setup from the out-of-the-box experience...\n\n  \n  \n  \n    Out-of-the-box tmux configuration.\n  \n  \n\nto this:\n\n  \n  \n  \n    End product tmux setup from this post.\n  \n  \n\nWe'll also change some of the stock options and keys to make using tmux more\nergonomic (IMHO). Feel free to jump around with the Table of Contents to any\nsections that interest you!\n\nNote: All tmux configuration snippets will live in ~/.tmux.conf unless\notherwise noted.\n\n\nKey Bindings\nJust for context, tmux defines two \"tables\" for key binds, essentially\nmappings of bindings to actions. The default table is the prefix table, where\nbinds are prefaced with the prefix key (think the common tmux controls like\nprefix + % or prefix + d). The other table is called the root table and\ndoesn't require the prefix preface in the binds. By default, bind-key adds\nthe mapping to the prefix table, but we can change this to add to the root table\nwith the -T option.\nRebinding Prefix Key\nThis is the most basic configuration option that I would suggest. By default,\ntmux defines the prefix key to be Ctrl + b, which I think is really\nawkward to type.\nFirst things first, let's start a new tmux session and edit ~/.tmux.conf in\nyour text editor of choice:\n\nThis is especially nice if you have homerow mods like me2 as it also\nconveniently keeps prefix on the homerow as well (in my case my right pinky\nfor Ctrl and then my left pinky for a)\nFor this to take effect, detach from your tmux session if you are in one, and\nrun tmux source ~/.tmux.conf. You can also stay in tmux and run source ~/.tmux.conf from the tmux command line prompt (accessed with prefix +\n:).\nRe-Source Configuration\nEven with only having done one configuration change and I already am tired of\nhaving to manually source our updated configuration every time. Let's fix that\nwith a key bind.\nWe can quickly resource our updated configuration file within an active tmux\nsession with prefix + r:\n\nSource the ~/.tmux.conf once last time, but from now on, when we make a\nconfiguration change in this post, simply use prefix + r to reload the\ncurrent tmux session. Much better! Let's continue.\nInteractive Session Handling with tmux-sessionizer\ntmux-sessionizer\nCreating new sessions in tmux with the new-session command and having to\nmanually specify the session directory with the -c flag gets old quick. We can\ninstead write a little shell script to let use fuzzy find the start directory\nfor the session and switch to it when it is created.\nThis is a script that I adapted from the\nThePrimeagen. He now maintains a\ndedicated GitHub repository\nfor the script with additional support for configuration files and more, but for\nme, I just like the basic core workflow of fuzzy-finding a project directory\nwith fzf and then instantiating a new\ntmux session.\n\nNote: Make sure you have fzf installed on your machine. Install instructions\n\nThe entire script (tmux-sessionizer.sh) is &lt; 50 lines of code:\n\nTo make the script executable and available, change the file permissions and\ncopy the it to your local binary folder:\n\nNow let's make a key bind to make this script accessible in any running tmux\ninstance:\n\nNow we can do prefix + f to invoke the script:\n\n  \n    \n    Your browser doesn't support the video tag, which I use in place of .gifs, and/or the video formats in use here\n    – sorry!\n  \n  \n  \n    tmux-sessionizer script in action\n  \n  \n\n\n  \n    \n      \n      \n        Making tmux-sessionizer Available in Neovim\n\n      \n      \n    \n    \n      For Neovim, in init.lua or which ever module you define your keymaps:\n\nNow while in Normal mode, I can hit Ctrl + f to execute the script in a new\ntmux window.\n\n    \n  \n\nYou can easily extend this script to make it your own. For example, you could do\nfurther setup of the session with some starter windows or support configuration\nfiles, etc.\n\nQuality of Life Options\nThere are a few quality of life options that I have set to make my tmux\nexperience easier and more interoperable with my other CLI tools.\nMouse Support\nBy default, tmux controls are purely keyboard-based. To enable using your\nmouse:\n\ntmux + (Neo)Vim Navigation\nIf you also use Vim/Neovim in tmux, I highly recommend\nchristoomey/vim-tmux-navigator,\nwhich allows you to navigate between tmux panes and Neovim splits using the same\nkeybindings (like &lt;C-h&gt;,&lt;C-j&gt;, &lt;C-k&gt;, and &lt;C-l&gt;).\n\nThen you will also need to install the plugin in Vim/Neovim:\n\nInstalling with lazy.nvim\nlazy.nvim:\n\n\nSystem Clipboard\nBy default, tmux will not copy to the system clipboard when you yank in copy\nmode (accessible with prefix + [):\n\n1-Based Indexing of Panes and Auto-Renumbering\nPanes and windows are normally 0-indexed, which does make it a little awkward\nwhen you want to switch to specific window index (prefix + &lt;index #&gt;) since\nthe 0 key is usually on the far right side of the number row. Additionally,\njust from aesthetic point of view, I think starting window at 1 is more\nintuitive and looks nicer.\n\nAdditionally, say we have three windows (now indexed 1-3), and we delete the\nsecond window. By default, tmux will keep the original numbering of the\nwindows, leaving you a gap with windows labeled 1 and 3. This is annoying, so\nlet's make tmux renumber the windows to 1 and 2 like we would expect:\n\nVi-Like Selection in Copy Mode\nWe can set vi bindings in copy mode (accessed with prefix + [) for more\ncrossover with Vim/Neovim:\n\nNow in copy mode you can you use the normal H/J/K/L navigation keys to\nget around the buffer, v to enter \"Visual\" mode, V to enter \"Visual-Line\"\nmode, and y to \"yank\" to the system clipboard.\n\nNote: I use pbcopy to copy to the system clipboard since I am on Mac, so\nyou may have to change this command to your system accordingly.\n\n\nMaking Use of Popup Menus\ntmux allows you to create popup menus with the display-popup command. I\nusually don't see this tmux command mentioned a lot but I have found these\npopup windows useful in some limited ways, but you could easily tailor them to\nyour use cases.\nSpotify Player\nOne of my favorite uses of popup menus in tmux has been using them to access\nmy favorite Spotify TUI,\nspotify-player, which\nacts as a CLI Spotify client.\nTo install with Homebrew, run:\n\nWith cargo:\n\n\nNOTE: For other installation options, see the spotify-player README.\n\nWe can define a keybind to create a new display popup running spotify-player\nand then close with prefix + d like any other tmux window:\n\nThe script will create a new tmux session called \"spotify\" if it doesn't exist\nalready, else it will reattach to the existing. The first check is to avoid\nsession nesting in the case you accidentally hit the defined Spotify keybind\nwithin the \"spotify\" session.\n\n  \n  \n  \n    Spotify Player TUI display popup.\n  \n  \n\nNavigating Sessions with fzf\nWe can add the following to create a popup to let us fuzzy-find our available\nsessions and switch to the one we select:\n\n~/dotfiles/tmux/session-fzf.sh:\n\nThe long list of options to fzf\n\nNote: I define I the script in a separate file because my Treesitter\nhighlighting always goes haywire with the quote escaping and it is easier to\njust define the script separate and just specify the script path for tmux\nusing the -E flag for display-popup.\n\n\n  \n  \n  \n    Using fzf to fuzzy-find sessions in a display\n  \n  \n\n\ntpm Package Manager\nIf you don't care about the extra overhead of a package manager, I would\nrecommend tpm for the extra\nconfiguration and aesthetic options it allows. However, it is perfectly fine to\nstop with the suggestions above and stick with tmux by itself and skip the\nrest of this section. I do limit myself to a very limited set of plugins to keep\nmy dependencies minimal.\nSetting Up tpm\nThe first thing we are going to do is clone tpm to our machine:\n\nAt the bottom of your .tmux.conf, add the following as a starting point:\n\nThen, re-source your updated configuration by running using our handy reload\nkeybind from earlier (prefix + r) and that's it for the basic setup! Now we\nhave the TPM plugin installed and we can start adding plugins under # List of plugins.\ntmux-continuum and tmux-resurrect\nWhile tmux sessions are persistent, they do not persist in the case that the\ntmux server itself is killed, such as in the case of a computer restart.\nHowever, we can fix this with the\ntmux-continuum and\ntmux-resurrect plugins.\nAdd them to our list of TPM plugins:\n\nNow install with prefix + I (capital I, not lowercase).\nNow in a case of restarts, you can use prefix + &lt;C-R&gt; to restore all of our\nprevious tmux sessions, windows, and panes. Of course, I don't use these\noften, but I am glad that I have them in these situations.\nCatppuccin-Themed Status Line with Add-ons\nI am a Catppuccin theme man all the way and I like having the unified look\nacross all my developer tools, which I do in tmux with catppuccin/tmux.\nDue to a naming conflict, the recommended way is to clone the Catppuccin theme\nlocally:\n\nOnce we do this, let's set up the status line and theme in ~/.tmux.conf:\n\nNotice the extra plugins tmux-plugins/tmux-battery and\ntmux-plugins/tmux-cpu, which I like so that my battery and CPU percentage is\nalso shown on the tmux status line.\nInstall the additional plugins with the prefix + I binding like we used\nbefore and check out our Catppuccin-themed status line:\n\n  \n  \n  \n    Catppuccin tmux status line.\n  \n  \n\n\nWrapping Up\nMy full .tmux.conf file can be found here.\nIf there's some low-hanging fruit of tmux quality of life options I missed, or\nyou have some nifty configuration yourself, I'd love to hear about it below!\n\nReferences\n2\nBlog: https://micahkepe.com/blog/piantor-keyboard/#home-row-mods-making-the-most-out-of-42-keyboards\nMore information about my homerow modifiers setup using QMK on my Piantor\n42-key keyboard.\n\n1\nMan Page: tmux(1)\n\n","id":"https://micahkepe.com/blog/tmux-config/","title":"Setting Up a Better tmux Configuration"},"https://micahkepe.com/blog/vimtutor-sequel/":{"body":"The vimtutor program is the essential starting point for anyone looking to learn\nthe basics of using Vim.

How could that be possible? This is the story of how a\nseemingly innocuous image format, WebP, was discovered to have a critical\nvulnerability that could be exploited to execute arbitrary code on a victim's\nmachine.\nUnderstanding Image Formats and Background on WebP\nUnder the hood, images are just binary data that represent pixels on a screen.\nDifferent image formats encode this data in various ways, each with its own\nstrengths and weaknesses. Some formats, like JPEG and PNG, are well-known and\nwidely used. Others, like Google's WebP format, are newer and less common but\noffer advantages such as better compression and transparency support. When a\nuser opens any picture, the picture has to be rendered on the screen by the\ncomputer by decoding the binary data contained in the image file. This decoding\nprocess is handled by an image decoder, which reads the image data, interprets\nit, and displays the image on the screen. The decoder must understand the\nspecific format of the image file to perform this task correctly.\n\n  \n  \n  \n    Above: The process of encoding and decoding a JPEG image.\n  \n  \n\nYou'll often hear about image formats being \"lossy\" or \"lossless.\" Lossy\nformats, like JPEG, discard some image data to achieve higher compression\nratios, while lossless formats, like PNG, preserve all the original data. WebP\nis unique in that it can be both lossy and lossless, depending on the settings\nused during encoding. This flexibility makes it a popular choice for web\ndevelopers looking to balance image quality and file size.\nThe libwebp is a popular open-source library that is used to encode and decode\nWebP images. It is widely used in web browsers, image editing software, and\nother applications that support the WebP format. The library provides functions\nfor reading and writing WebP images, as well as encoding and decoding the pixel\ndata. The vulnerability in WebP that we will discuss later is related to the\nlossless encoding and decoding process used by the libwebp library.\nThe Complexity of Huffman Encoding and Decoding\nWebP's lossless variant is based on a technique called Huffman encoding, which\nis used to compress data by assigning shorter codes to more frequent symbols.\nThis process involves building a binary tree where each symbol corresponds to a\nunique path from the root to a leaf node. The tree is then used to encode and\ndecode the data efficiently.\nTo illustrate this concept, consider a simple example where we have four symbols\n(A, B, C, and D) whose frequencies are as follows:\n\nA: 50%\nB: 25%\nC: 15%\nD: 10%\n\nThe Huffman tree for these symbols might look like this:\n\nIn this tree, the symbol A is encoded as 0, B as 10, C as 110, and D as\n111. When encoding a sequence of symbols, we traverse the tree from the root\nto the leaf node corresponding to each symbol, generating a binary code along\nthe way. This process ensures that more frequent symbols are assigned shorter\ncodes, reducing the overall size of the encoded data.\nHuffman tables are used to store the mapping between symbols and their\ncorresponding codes. These tables are typically constructed during the encoding\nprocess and are required for decoding the data. For the example above, the\nHuffman table might look like this:\nSymbolCode\nA0\nB10\nC110\nD111\n\nAs you can see, the most frequent symbol (A) is assigned the shortest code,\nwhile the least frequent symbol (D) is assigned the longest code. This property\nof Huffman encoding helps achieve efficient compression by reducing the average\ncode length. Huffman tables effectively capture the structure of the Huffman\ntree, with one table per alphabet size (number of symbols) used in the encoding\nprocess.\nIn the case of WebP, the Huffman tree is stored in the image file along with the\nencoded pixel data. When the image is decoded, the tree is reconstructed, and\nthe pixel data is decoded using the tree's structure.\nThe WebP Vulnerability (CVE-2023-4863)\nIn September 2023, a critical vulnerability was discovered in the WebP image\nformat that allowed attackers to execute arbitrary code on a victim's machine.\nThe vulnerability, assigned CVE-2023-4863, was caused by a heap buffer overflow\nin the Huffman decoding process. By crafting a specially designed WebP image, an\nattacker could trigger the overflow and overwrite memory in the decoder, leading\nto a variety of potential exploits.\nBut triggering the vulnerability is not as simple as sending a malicious image\nfile to a victim. The attacker must carefully construct the image to exploit the\nspecific conditions that trigger the heap buffer overflow. This requires a deep\nunderstanding of the WebP format and the internal workings of the decoder,\nmaking it a non-trivial task even for experienced security researchers.\nBen Hawkes, the Project Zero team lead at Google, described the following steps\nto trigger the vulnerability:\n\n\nConstruct a sequence of 4 valid Huffman tables that are maximally sized for\ntwo different alphabet sizes (280 and 256).\n\n\nNext, construct a very specific type of invalid Huffman table for a third\nalphabet size (40).\n\n\nFinally, the vulnerability will be manifested in the BuildHuffmanTable\nfunction in the libwebp library when the invalid Huffman table is\nprocessed. The issue is that there was no length check on the buffer that was\nallocated for the Huffman table, which could lead to an out-of-bounds write\nwhen the invalid table is unpacked by the decoder. This means the function\ncould be coerced into writing data beyond the allocated buffer, leading to an\nout-of-bounds write and potential memory corruption. The overflow will lead\nto a double-free vulnerability, which can be exploited to execute arbitrary\ncode.\n\n\nIf any of the above steps are not followed correctly, the vulnerability will not\nbe triggered and the image decoder will simply throw an error. Practically, this\nmeans that exploiting the vulnerability requires a high level of expertise and\nknowledge of the WebP format, making it unlikely to be used in widespread\nattacks.\nmistymntncop, a security researcher, created\na proof-of-concept exploit for the WebP vulnerability, and produced this\nvisualization of the unbalanced Huffman table the is constructed from the\ncrafted WebP image:\n\n  \n  \n  \n    Above: An unbalanced Huffman tree created\nfrom a crafted WebP image.\n  \n  \n\nIn contrast, here is the visualization balanced Huffman tree created from a\nvalid WebP image:\n\n  \n  \n  \n    Above: A balanced Huffman tree created\nfrom a valid WebP image.\n  \n  \n\nHow Was This Not Caught Earlier?\nEven though there are many fuzzing tools and techniques available to detect\nvulnerabilities in software, the reason this bug was not caught earlier is\nmostly due to the sheer complexity and specificity of the conditions required to\ntrigger it. As Hawkes mentions in his zero-day disclosure, \"[o]ut of billions\nof possibilities,\" only a 4 table sequence of a specific size and an invalid\ntable of a specific size will trigger the vulnerability.\nTo see for yourself how complex the conditions are, you can check out the nearly\n600-line C code that was used to trigger the vulnerability\nhere.\nConclusion\nThis vulnerability has since been patched, so if you're using the most recent\nversions of your browsers than you can rest easy that you're not susceptible to\nthis attack. However, the WebP vulnerability serves as a reminder that security\nvulnerabilities can lurk in unexpected places, even in seemingly benign image\nformats. As software systems become more complex and interconnected, it is\nessential to conduct thorough security assessments of all components, including\nimage decoders and parsers. By identifying and addressing vulnerabilities\nproactively, we can help prevent potential exploits and protect users from\nmalicious attacks.\nReferences\n\nJPEG Image Encoding and Decoding Figure\nUncovering the Hidden WebP vulnerability: a tale of a CVE with much bigger implications than it originally seemed\nCVE-2023-4863 Detail\nWEBP’S WEAK SPOT: UNVEILING THE HIDDEN VULNERABILITY\nThe WebP 0day\nExplanation from the Youtube channel Low Level Learning\nProof-of-Concept for CVE-2023-4863 by Hawkes and mistymntncop\n\n","id":"https://micahkepe.com/blog/webp-vulnerability/","title":"WebP: A Case Study in the Hidden Vulnerabilities of Image Formats"},"https://micahkepe.com/blog/welcome/":{"body":"Congratulations!

In this post, we'll get\nour feet wet in writing Bash scripts and combine them with some powerful Unix\ntools to create a powerful and versatile toolset. We'll also explore how you can\nuse Hammerspoon, a macOS automation tool, to take your automation to the next\nlevel.\nIntroduction\nAs a college student, I find that most of my peers have little to no experience\nwith the command line interface (CLI) and Unix tools. This is unfortunate, as\npersonally after discovering Vim, tmux, and other Unix tools, I have found that\nI have become more productive, enjoyed writing code more, and have a better\nunderstanding of how my machine works. This is not to say that editors like\nVisual Studio Code or IDEs are bad (I myself used Visual Studio Code for a long\ntime), but rather that Unix tools provide a different way of working that can\nbe more efficient and enjoyable for some people. Even if you don't end up using\nUnix tools in your daily workflow, understanding them can be beneficial, as they\nare the foundation of many modern tools and technologies.\nFor Vim users and those trying to minimize their mouse usage, these tools also\nallow you to do everything from file navigation to text manipulation without\never leaving the keyboard. Even for non-Vim users, these tools can still be\nuseful for automating repetitive tasks, managing files, and more.\n\nYour 20 Minute Intro to Bash\nBash can be a little intimidating at first, but it is actually quite simple once\nyou get the hang of it. In this section, we will cover the basics of Bash\nscripting to get you started. By no means at the end of this will you be an\nexpert at writing Bash scripts, but we will know enough to write some useful\nscripts of our own.\nVariables\nJust like you would expect, variables are assigned using the = operator. Here\nis an example:\n\nNotice that there are no spaces around the = operator. Also, Bash does not\ndistinguish between different types of variables, so you can assign a string to\na variable and then assign an integer to the same variable.\nHere's some basic things we can do with variables:\n\nSupported Data Types in Bash\nBash doesn't strongly differentiate data types the way higher-level languages do.\nAll variables are essentially strings. For arithmetic operations, Bash evaluates\nthe variable contents as integers if possible. Arrays in Bash are just lists of\nstrings. There's no native support for complex data structures out of the box,\nbut you can do a lot with what is provided.\nExamples:\n\nThere’s no separate syntax for declaring a variable as an integer vs. a string.\nIt’s all context-based.\nBash Loops and Comparisons\nBash Loops\nBash loops and conditionals have a somewhat unusual syntax when coming from\nlanguages like Python or Java. The key patterns to remember are:\n\nif ... then ... fi for conditionals\nfor ... do ... done for loops\nwhile ... do ... done and until ... do ... done for other loop constructs\n\nBash uses fi to end an if block, and done to end loops. This might\nfeel odd at first, but you’ll get used to it quickly.\nfor loops:\n\nThis loop iterates over all .txt files in the current directory. The do\nkeyword starts the loop's body, and done ends it.\nwhile loops:\n\nThis loop runs as long as the condition [ $count -le 5 ] is true (we'll go\nover the syntax for comparisons in a bit). The count=$((count+1)) line\nincrements the value of the count variable by 1.\nif statements:\n\nIn Bash, if blocks always end with fi. Also notice we use [ and ]\naround the condition; this is part of Bash's test syntax.\nBash Comparisons\nBash has wonky syntax for comparisons that you just have to memorize\nunfortunately.\nBash uses different forms of brackets and parentheses for distinct purposes,\nwhich can be confusing at first. The single brackets [ ] are essentially a\nshorthand for the test command and are used for conditional checks. The\ndouble brackets [[ ]] are a Bash-specific enhancement that provides more\nfeatures, like regular expression matching and simplified handling of strings\nwithout the need for extensive quoting. For arithmetic operations, double\nparentheses (( )) treat variables as integers and allow direct arithmetic\nevaluation, while command substitution uses $( ) to run a command and\ncapture its output.\ntldr: [ ] and [[ ]] are for conditionals, with [[ ]] being more\nversatile and safer in many cases; (( )) handles arithmetic cleanly, and\n$( ) executes commands and returns their results. Understanding these\nsubtle differences will make your Bash scripts more reliable and easier to read.\n\nArithmetic Comparisons\nBashMeaning\n-lt&lt;\n-gt&gt;\n-le&lt;=\n-ge&gt;=\n-eq==\n-ne!=\n\n\nExample:\n\n \nString Comparisons\nBashMeaning\n=equal\n!=not equal\n&lt;less than\n&gt;greater than\n-n s1string s1 is not empty\n-z s1string s1 is empty\n\n\nExample:\n\nReading User Input and Trapping\nThe read command will let us retrieve data from stdin.\n\nNext, we can use the trap command to execute another command after an event\nlike a sent signal such as SIGINT (Ctrl + C):\n\nExecuting Bash files\nTo actually be able to run a Bash scripts, we need to do two things: (1) make\nthe file executable and (2) add a shebang to the file.\nThe shebang is a special line at the beginning of a script that tells the\noperating system what interpreter to use to run the script. The shebang for\nBash scripts is #!/bin/bash. Here is an example of a simple Bash script:\n\nBreaking down the shebang, you'll notice that #! is the shebang character\nsequence, and /bin/bash is the path to the Bash interpreter. The shebang line\nmust be the first line of the script, as it tells your operating system how\nto run the script. Without it, the script will not run since the operating system\nwill not know what interpreter to use.\nNow to actually run the script, save it to a file (e.g. hello.sh), make it\nexecutable using the chmod command, and then run it:\n\nThen to run the script, use ./hello.sh.\nThat's it for our 20 minute intro to Bash. There is still a lot more to learn,\nbut this should be enough to get you started writing some simple scripts.\nIf you are interested in learning more, I recommend checking out the resources I\nhave linked at the end of this post or this Youtube video:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n  \n\n\nUnix Tools 101\nUnix Philosophy\nBefore diving into Unix tools, it is important to understand the Unix philosophy,\nnot only because it is the foundation of Unix tools, but also because it is a\ndesign philosophy that leads to the powerful combinations and versatility of Unix\ntools.\nThis philosophy can be summarized as follows:\n\nWrite programs that do one thing and do it well.\nWrite programs to work together.\nWrite programs to handle text streams, because that is a universal interface.\n\nThese rules are simple but have powerful implications. By writing programs that\ndo one thing well, you can create a set of tools that can be combined in\ndifferent ways to accomplish complex tasks. By writing programs to work together,\nyou can create powerful tool chains that can accomplish tasks that would be\ndifficult or impossible with a single program. By writing programs to handle text\nstreams, you can create tools that can be used in a wide variety of contexts,\nsince text streams are a universal interface.\nCommon Unix-like Tools\ntldr: simpler man pages\ntldr provides simplified man page that provides practical examples of how to\nuse a command.\nYou can also get platform-specific man pages with the --platform flag like\nthis:\n\nfzf: powerful fuzzy finder\nFor basic use, just running fzf will fuzzy find recursively on all files in\nthe present working directory. However, the tldr page for fzf also lists out\nsome more complex commands with fzf:\n\nfzf will list the files in a nicely formatted list that you can navigate using\neither the arrow keys or Vim-like bindings using Ctrl + &lt;hjkl&gt;.\nfzf also has shell integration functions that are very helpful. To set up the\nintegration you'll need to add the following to your shell's respective\nconfiguration file:\n\nRelaunch your shell to source the new configuration. Now we can use the provided\nshell functionality.\n\n  \n    \n      \n      \n        Note for fish shell\n\n      \n      \n    \n    \n      I use Fish shell, and while fzf has a fish plugin, but it doesn't seem well\nmaintained and I had issues, use fzf.fish\ninstead, which actually has a lot of bonus features as well like finding\nprocesses and variables.\n\n    \n  \n\ntmux: terminal manager\ntmux is a terminal multiplexer, in the future I will most likely have a whole\npost dedicated to tmux and how I use it, but for now, just know that it is a\nterminal multiplexer that allows you to split your terminal into multiple panes,\ncreate sessions, and more. For now, let's just look at some basic commands.\nBy default, tmux uses Ctrl + b as a \"prefix\" key, which means that you press\nCtrl + b and then another key to execute a command. (You can change this to\na more convenient keybinding, a common one is Ctrl + a; you can do this by\nadding set -g prefix C-a to your ~/.tmux.conf file.)\nHere are some common tmux commands:\n\nWhen you are in a tmux session, you can press Ctrl + b and then ? to see\na list of all the keybindings available to you.\nsed (Stream Editor)/ grep/ awk: text processing\nsed and awk are text processing tools that allow you to manipulate text\nfiles in various ways. grep is a tool that allows you to search for specific\nlines in a file.\nHere are some examples:\n\nhtop: system processes management\nhtop is an interactive process viewer that provides a more user-friendly\ninterface than the traditional top command. It allows you to sort, filter,\nand kill processes easily.\nHere are some examples:\n\nI recommend checking out the tldr page for htop for more examples and\nexploring around in htop to see what it can do.\nbat: cat, but better\nbat is a drop-in replacement for cat that adds syntax highlighting, line\nnumbers, and Git integration.\nExamples:\n\nrg: faster grep\nrg (ripgrep) a faster alternative to grep, which is optimized for searching\nlarge files and directories. It is a drop-in replacement for grep and is\nfaster than both grep and ag (The Silver Searcher).\nExamples:\n\nPractical Examples of Combining Unix-like Tools\nFinding Files with a Certain Keyword\n\nEnhanced nvim Command\nBy default, we can open a new Neovim session in the current directory by simply\nrunning nvim in the terminal. This is perfectly fine, but we can fine tune it\nmore by adding in some of the tools that we have looked at.\nFirst, let's add the file selected from fzf to be what we open the Neovim\nsession in:\n\nLet's also pass a bat command to fzf's '--preview to let us see the files\nas we navigate them with fzf.\n\nAnother thing we can enable with fzf is the -m flag, which will allow us to\nselect multiple files with TAB and then these will be put in open buffers when\nwe open Neovim!\n\nTo make this the default behavior for when we open Neovim, we can save this\nenhanced command as an alias for nvim. Instead your ~/.zshrc, ~/.bashrc,\n~/.config/fish/config.fish, etc.:\n\nThePrimeagen's tmux-sessionizer Script\nAnother great example of combining tools is this tmux-sessionizer.sh script\nthat I adapted from ThePrimeagen:\n\nAdd this script to your $PATH and create an alias in your shell configuration\nfile (e.g. .bashrc, .zshrc) like:\n\nThen you can simply run with tmux-sessionizer. You'll be prompted to select a\ndirectory with fzf and then a new tmux session will be created with that\ndirectory as the working directory.\n\nBringing It All Together: Crafting a Powerful, Personalized Workflow\nUp to this point, we’ve looked at individual tools and scripting techniques—Bash\nbasics, command-line utilities like fzf and rg, terminal multiplexing with\ntmux, text manipulation with sed and awk, and system automation via\nHammerspoon. While each tool stands on its own, the true power emerges when\nyou combine them to fit the way you work.\nImagine this scenario: You’re working on a large codebase and need to\nquickly find a function definition. Instead of manually poking around\ndirectories, you can run a single command:\n\nWith this pipeline, you’ve integrated multiple tools at once:\n\nrg searches your codebase blazingly fast.\nfzf lets you quickly narrow down results interactively.\nbat provides syntax-highlighted previews as you navigate files.\nnvim opens the selected file immediately in your preferred editor.\n\nNeed to juggle multiple projects and keep different tasks compartmentalized?\nUse tmux-sessionizer to jump into dedicated tmux sessions for each\ndirectory you’re working in—no more manually cd’ing and setting up your\nenvironment each time. Once inside tmux, you can split panes to run htop\nand monitor processes on one side, while coding on the other. If you’re on\nmacOS, you can rearrange or tile your windows effortlessly with Hammerspoon\nkeybindings. Each tool handles a specific part of your workflow, and together\nthey create a frictionless environment where you move seamlessly between\nsearching, editing, monitoring, and organizing.\nIn short: The point of learning these tools and techniques isn’t just to\nhave a bag of fancy tricks. It’s about building a workflow that’s tailored to\nyour needs—reducing repetitive actions, speeding up navigation, and keeping\nyou focused on your real work rather than on the mechanics of your environment.\nAs you become comfortable with these tools, you’ll naturally discover even\nmore combinations, customizing your setup to become a personal productivity\npowerhouse.\nIf there's any tool or script that you found particularly useful or interesting,\nI recommend exploring it further and seeing how you can integrate it into your\nworkflow. And if you have a favorite tool or script that I didn't cover here,\nfeel free to share it in the comments!\n\nEXTRA: Automating with Hammerspoon (MacOS)\n\nNOTE: Sorry Windows and Linux users, this section is MacOS-specific. If you\nhave any suggestions for similar tools on Windows or Linux, please let me know!\n\nHammerspoon is a powerful macOS automation tool that allows you to write Lua\nscripts to automate your workflow. It is similar to Automator, but with more\npower and flexibility. Hammerspoon can be used to automate window management,\nlaunch applications, and more.\nTo be fair, I there is still so much of Hammerspoon's capabilities that I just\nhaven't had the time to look at or don't know about, but the biggest thing that\nI use it for is window management. I have a script that I use to manage my\nwindows that I will share below. These make it easy to move windows around,\nresize them, and switch between them without ever having to touch the mouse.\nGetting Started with Hammerspoon\nWith Homebrew, you can install Hammerspoon with the following command:\n\nNow with Hammerspoon installed, we can start scripting using Lua. Our scripts\nwill live in the ~/.hammerspoon directory and and then load the modules in\n~/.hammerspoon/init.lua using require(&lt;modname&gt;) statements.\nWindow Sizing\nLet's create a file called window.lua in ~/.hammerspoon/ and add the\nfollowing code:\n\nTo actually include the this window script, add the following to\n~/.hammerspoon/init.lua:\n\nSave the file and reload your Hammerspoon configuration (you can do this by\nclicking on the Hammerspoon icon in the menu bar and selecting \"Reload Config\").\nNow try using the keybinds you set up to move your windows around. Use Alt + CMD + &lt;arrow&gt; to move the active window to one of the four halves (vertically\nand horizontally split) of the screen. You can also use Alt + CMD + SHIFT + &lt;arrow&gt; to move the window to one of the window quarters.\nWindow Switching\nWhile macOS has a provided CMD + Tab shortcut for context switching windows,\nthere aren't previews for the windows and hidden/minimized windows are not\navailable. Hammerspoon's window.switcher\nAPI allows for overcoming both of these shortcomings.\nAdd the following to the end of your ~/.hammerspoon/window.lua file:\n\nNow with these key bindings I can quickly switch windows using Alt + Tab and\nhave previews! Try them out yourself. Alt + Tab will iterate through the\nwindows in order, and Alt + Shift + Tab will iterate through the windows in\nreverse order.\n\nReferences and Resources\n\nUnix Philosophy Wikipedia page\ntypescraft: This may be my favorite CLI tool ever\nJosean Martinez: 7 Amazing CLI Tools You Need To Try\nBash Scripting Tutorial: How to Write a Bash Script\nBash Scripting Tutorial for Beginners\nfzf GitHub Repository\nfzf.fish GitHub Repository\nripgrep GitHub Repository\n\n","id":"https://micahkepe.com/blog/workflow-automation/","title":"Using Bash, Unix Tools, and Hammerspoon to Speed Up Your Workflow"}},"docInfo":{"https://micahkepe.com/blog/":{"body":0,"title":0},"https://micahkepe.com/blog/43-monkeys/":{"body":1209,"title":6},"https://micahkepe.com/blog/ai-job-impact/":{"body":1024,"title":6},"https://micahkepe.com/blog/bloom-filters/":{"body":861,"title":7},"https://micahkepe.com/blog/gitconfig/":{"body":1397,"title":7},"https://micahkepe.com/blog/ingenious-algorithms/":{"body":1562,"title":8},"https://micahkepe.com/blog/minishell/":{"body":1725,"title":4},"https://micahkepe.com/blog/missing-semester/":{"body":707,"title":6},"https://micahkepe.com/blog/neovim-setup/":{"body":1259,"title":5},"https://micahkepe.com/blog/piantor-keyboard/":{"body":1305,"title":4},"https://micahkepe.com/blog/software-packages/":{"body":672,"title":3},"https://micahkepe.com/blog/sqlite-query-optimizer/":{"body":1700,"title":5},"https://micahkepe.com/blog/thompson-trojan-horse/":{"body":1041,"title":7},"https://micahkepe.com/blog/tmux-config/":{"body":1279,"title":5},"https://micahkepe.com/blog/vimtutor-sequel/":{"body":380,"title":4},"https://micahkepe.com/blog/webp-vulnerability/":{"body":780,"title":7},"https://micahkepe.com/blog/welcome/":{"body":57,"title":5},"https://micahkepe.com/blog/workflow-automation/":{"body":1572,"title":8}},"length":18},"lang":"English"}
