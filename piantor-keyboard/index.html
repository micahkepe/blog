<span id="continue-reading"></span><h2 id="why"><a class="zola-anchor" href="#why" aria-label="Anchor link for: why">Why?</a></h2>
<p>A few months ago I stumbled upon a YouTube video<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#1">1</a></sup> that would start off this
whole chain of events.</p>











<div class="responsive-iframe"
  style="width: 100%; max-width: 100%; margin: 0 auto; text-align: center;">
  <iframe
    src="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;embed&#x2F;7UXsD7nSfDY"
    title="YouTube video player"
    frameborder="0"
    allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share"
    referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin"
    allowfullscreen>
  </iframe>
</div>
<p>This seriously is an amazing video and I recommend giving it a watch. It's a
great introduction to the world of custom keyboards and the rabbit hole that
comes with it.</p>
<h2 id="the-issues-with-the-standard-qwerty-keyboard"><a class="zola-anchor" href="#the-issues-with-the-standard-qwerty-keyboard" aria-label="Anchor link for: the-issues-with-the-standard-qwerty-keyboard">The Issues with the Standard QWERTY Keyboard</a></h2>
<p>The main issues with the standard QWERTY keyboard can be summarized with the
following:</p>
<h3 id="diagonal-columns"><a class="zola-anchor" href="#diagonal-columns" aria-label="Anchor link for: diagonal-columns">Diagonal Columns</a></h3>
<p>The keys on a standard QWERTY keyboard are arranged in diagonal columns. This is
an artifact of the typewriter days when the keys were arranged in this way to
prevent the jamming of the mechanical keys. This is no longer an issue with
modern keyboards that use electrical switches, but the design stayed.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Aside</strong>: If you've spent time tinkering with Vim, you might have noticed
that the Enter key is often called <code>&lt;CR&gt;</code> for "carriage return," which is
another artifact of the typewriter days.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As a consequence, keys like <code>B</code> are a huge stretch on modern keyboards. This
makes proper touch typing difficult as you'll most likely need to take your
hands off the home row to reach these keys or resort to using non-standard
finger placements.</p>
<h3 id="modifier-keys-placement"><a class="zola-anchor" href="#modifier-keys-placement" aria-label="Anchor link for: modifier-keys-placement">Modifier Keys Placement</a></h3>
<p>The modifier keys (<code>Ctrl</code>, <code>Option</code>, <code>Command</code>/<code>Super</code>, <code>Shift</code>) are placed in
the corners of the board, making it nearly impossible to keep your fingers on
the homerow while using them. This is especially frustrating for Vim users, as
the <code>Ctrl</code> key is used in many keybindings as well as basic Vim built-in
commands like navigating up and down the page with <code>Ctrl+U</code> and <code>Ctrl+D</code>.</p>
<h3 id="hand-position-and-ergonomics"><a class="zola-anchor" href="#hand-position-and-ergonomics" aria-label="Anchor link for: hand-position-and-ergonomics">Hand Position and Ergonomics</a></h3>
<p>Standard keyboards force our wrists and hands into unnatural positions that can
lead to repetitive strain injuries (RSI) over time. The main issues include:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Ulnar Deviation</strong>: Our wrists are forced to bend outward to align with the
keyboard</li>
<li><strong>Wrist Extension</strong>: Many keyboards, especially non-mechanical ones, require
lifting our wrists</li>
<li><strong>Shoulder Tension</strong>: Hands are typically held closer together than shoulder
width</li>
<li><strong>Finger Stretching</strong>: Reaching for numbers and symbols often requires awkward
stretches</li>
</ul>
<p>A split keyboard addresses these issues by allowing each half to be positioned
at shoulder width and angled to maintain neutral wrist position.</p>

<h2 id="the-piantor"><a class="zola-anchor" href="#the-piantor" aria-label="Anchor link for: the-piantor">The Piantor</a></h2>
<p>After watching quite a few YouTube videos and reading a lot of blog posts, I
settled on the <a href="https://shop.beekeeb.com/product/pre-soldered-piantor-split-keyboard/">Piantor
keyboard</a><sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#2">2</a></sup>.
The main reasons I chose this board were:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>42 keys</strong>: good balance of portability and compactness, with enough
functionality overlap with a standard full-sized QWERTY keyboard that wouldn't
make switching between the two completely alien</li>
<li><strong>wired</strong>: I wanted a wired keyboard to avoid the hassle of charging and from
the research I did, it seems that wired keyboards are more reliable than
wireless</li>
<li><strong>great shop</strong>: Leo at BeeKeeb really is super helpful and responsive. The
shop is only a two-man operation in Hong Kong, so it's nice to support a small
business that does great work</li>
<li><strong>pre-built</strong>: I briefly considered building my own keyboard, but I decided
that I wanted to get a pre-built one to avoid the hassle of soldering and
flashing firmware.</li>
</ul>
<p>With that out of the way, I placed my order and waited for the board to arrive.</p>

<p>The initial setup of any split keyboard requires patience. There's a significant
learning curve, but the ergonomic benefits make it worthwhile. Here's my
journey:</p>
<h3 id="initial-challenges"><a class="zola-anchor" href="#initial-challenges" aria-label="Anchor link for: initial-challenges">Initial Challenges</a></h3>
<p>My preview WPM dropped to a snail's pace. The main challenges were:</p>
<ul>
<li>Adapting to the columnar layout instead of staggered keys</li>
<li>Learning to use layers effectively</li>
<li>Training my thumbs to do more than just hit the spacebar</li>
<li>Getting comfortable with home row mods</li>
</ul>

<p>The most common firmware for custom keyboards are <a href="https://qmk.fm/">QMK</a> and
<a href="https://zmkfirmware.dev/">ZMK</a>. QMK is the most popular firmware for custom
wire keyboards, while ZMK is a newer firmware that supports wireless keyboards.
Because I'm using a wired keyboard, I'll be using QMK.</p>
<h3 id="layers"><a class="zola-anchor" href="#layers" aria-label="Anchor link for: layers">Layers</a></h3>
<p>The board comes with a default layer mapping, but I quickly realized that I
would need to change it to fit how I work.</p>
<p>As I do a lot of work in the terminal, especially in Neovim and Tmux sessions, I
wanted to prioritize the <code>ESCAPE</code>, <code>Enter</code>, <code>Ctrl</code>, and <code>Option</code> as I use these
for tons of keymaps and navigating around.</p>

    <p style="font-style: italic;">The base layer of the split keyboard. As you can see,
it is mostly a standard QWERTY layout except for the home row mods and the thumb
keys.</p>
  </caption>
  
</section>
<p>The base layer had the least amount of customization done. Ignore the <code>TD</code> keys
for now, we'll go over those more in the section on home row mods. The main
thing to see is that with the base layer, the keyboard is essentially a 42-key
board that you can use to type in QWERTY, plus the thumb keys.</p>
<p>The thumb keys are one of the most powerful aspects of this layout. Our thumbs
are naturally strong and dexterous, yet on traditional keyboards, they' re
relegated to just hitting the spacebar. On the Piantor, I've configured my thumb
keys to handle space, enter, and layer switching - tasks that traditionally
required awkward pinky stretches or hand movement.</p>

    <p style="font-style: italic;">The first layer of the split keyboard. This is where I am
able to access my numbers and symbols.</p>
  </caption>
  
</section>
<p>This is where things start to get a little more spicy.</p>
<p>On my left hand, I have access to numbers, a period for writing floating point
numbers, and the <code>Shift</code> state of the normal number row.</p>
<p>On the right side, I have all the symbols remaining from the board, with the top
row being the rest of the <code>Shift</code> values of the normal number row and the rest
of my symbols like <code>()</code>, <code> {}</code>, and so on. This definitely took a lot of time to
get used to, but soon muscle memory took over.</p>

<p>One of my favorite aspects of this layer is the arrow key placement. They map
directly to the Vim movement keys (HJKL), which means I'm using the same spatial
memory I've built up from Vim. This makes navigation incredibly smooth and
intuitive - there's no cognitive overhead of learning new positions since they
perfectly align with movements I already know.</p>

<p>I found that I needed to use
<a href="https://karabiner-elements.pqrs.org/">Karabiner-Elements</a> to retain some of the
functionality that I had with my old keyboard. The main source of frustration
was from the Mac media keys not working with the Piantor keyboard. I was able to
fix this by simply just using Karabiner-Elements without any additional
configuration, which I'm sure exactly that fixed the issue, but if it ain't
broke, don't fix it. My guess is that by default my Macbook is interpreting the
media keys as function keys, so I just had to make sure that the media keys were
being used instead of the function keys.</p>

<p>Returning to those <code>TD</code> keys, these refer to "tap dance" keys, which are keys
that can be configured to do different things depending on how long you hold
them down. In my case, I've configured them to be home row modifiers.</p>
<p>Home row mods are when you configure your homerow keys to act as modifiers when
held down. This is a great way to keep your fingers on the home row while still
having access to all the modifier keys you need. I have found that I prefer this
setup way more than the traditional modifier key placement and that I am looking
to carry this over to my laptop keyboard as well.</p>
<p>There are many different layouts<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#3">3</a></sup>,<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#4">4</a></sup> of the modifiers that are possible,
however I settled on the following, which I believe gives me a good balance of
the keys as a MacOS user who frequently uses all of these keys often in
combination:</p>
<p><strong>Left hand modifiers:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><code>A</code>: Ctrl when held</li>
<li><code>S</code>: Alt when held</li>
<li><code>D</code>: GUI (Command) when held</li>
<li><code>F</code>: Shift when held</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Right hand modifiers:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><code>J</code>: Shift when held</li>
<li><code>K</code>: GUI (Command) when held</li>
<li><code>L</code>: Alt when held</li>
<li><code>;</code>: Ctrl when held</li>
</ul>
<p>This setup provides several advantages:</p>
<ol>
<li>Your fingers never leave the home row to access modifiers</li>
<li>The modifiers are symmetrically arranged, making them easier to remember</li>
<li>The strongest fingers (index and middle) control the most commonly used
modifiers</li>
<li>Every modifier is accessible without any stretching or hand contortion</li>
</ol>
<p>The learning curve for home row mods is steep - it took me about two weeks to
stop accidentally triggering modifiers while typing normally. The key is to
adjust the tapping term (how long you need to hold a key for it to register as a
hold rather than a tap) to find your sweet spot. In my configuration, I've set
this to 150ms, which provides a good balance between preventing accidental
activations and maintaining quick access to the modifiers.</p>
<p>I also made the right middle thumb key have a tap dance as well where when I tap
it is the <code>Esc</code> key and when I hold it toggles the second layer. This is
something that I found really convenient when working in Vim since I use the
<code>Esc</code> key so often when switching modes.</p>

      <p>For configuring home row mods on the built-in Mac laptop keyboard, you can
use Karabiner-Elements or <a href="https://github.com/kmonad/kmonad">KMonad</a>.
Personally, I used Karabiner-Elements, which lets you set up home row mods using
a JSON configuration file. I used the JSON from this <a href="https://havn.blog/2024/03/03/a-good-way.html">blog

<p>Switching to a split keyboard meant essentially relearning how to type. Here are
the tools that helped me make the transition:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong><a href="https://www.keybr.com/">Keybr</a></strong>: This was invaluable for relearning proper
touch typing. The adaptive algorithm helped me focus on problematic keys and
gradually build up speed without developing bad habits.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong><a href="https://monkeytype.com/">MonkeyType</a></strong>: Once I had the basics down,
MonkeyType helped me work on speed and accuracy. Its clean interface and
variety of text options kept practice sessions engaging.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong><a href="https://github.com/keycastr/keycastr">KeyCastr</a></strong>: This visual key display
tool was crucial for debugging my typing. Being able to see my keystrokes in
real-time helped me catch mistakes and verify I was using the correct keys,
especially when working with different layers.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Tip</strong>: If you're making the switch, I recommend starting with Keybr to build
proper fundamentals, then graduating to MonkeyType for speed training. Keep
KeyCastr running initially to catch any layer or modifier key mistakes.</p>

<h2 id="conclusion-is-it-worth-it"><a class="zola-anchor" href="#conclusion-is-it-worth-it" aria-label="Anchor link for: conclusion-is-it-worth-it">Conclusion: Is it Worth It?</a></h2>
<p><strong>It depends</strong>. If you're looking for a new hobby and are willing to spend a lot
of time and the money on a keyboard, then I think it could potentially be a good
choice.</p>
<p>Personally, I love the uniqueness of the board, the customization options, and
overall the smoothness and tactility of the experience. Just from the short time
that I have been using this board I've noticed:</p>
<ul>
<li>My touch typing has significantly improved</li>
<li>Absolutely no wrist pain, which I would sometimes get from prolonged coding
sessions in the past.</li>
<li>Much more enjoyable typing experience overall (some "shiny object syndrome" is
definitely at play too here)</li>
<li>Rarely having to use my mouse anymore as I just began using keyboard shortcuts
for everything. This includes navigating around the Brave browser, which comes
with native keyboard navigation shortcuts like <code>Space</code> to page down, since
all of my modifier keys are now so easily accessible from either my home row
or thumbs. I have also added more shortcuts to my Hammerspoon configuration
for all sorts of quick app toggling.</li>
</ul>
<p>Honestly, if you've already drank the Kool-Aid with Vim... this is just the next
step on your journey to becoming an even bigger nerd.</p>
