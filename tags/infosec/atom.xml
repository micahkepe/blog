        <summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;When Ken Thompson won the Turing Award jointly with Dennis Ritchie for their
work in UNIX, he was expected like other Turing winners to write a paper that
would be published in the ACM Computer Journal. What he ended up submitting was
a paper about &quot;the cutest program [he] ever wrote&quot;-- a sneaky undetectable
self-reproducing &quot;Trojan horse&quot; backdoor in the C compiler that would allow him
to log into affected machines as any user.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;</summary>
